    "#\n",
    "# 1. Added functions to handle and get styled usernames.\n",
    "#    This function is called if no username is detected for a post after\n",
    "#    first trying to use the original function to get normal usernames.\n",
    "# 2. Added function to make custom comment IDs called \"My Comment ID\" in output.\n",
    "# 3. Added function to make list of URLs for output\n",
    "#    where len(URLs) = len(comments) and all items are the same video URL.\n",
    "# 4. Added function to get video's title from top of page below the video player.\n",
    "# 5. Added function to make list of video titles for output\n",
    "#    where len(video_titles) = len(comments) and all items are the same video title.\n",

    "# V2-3 Notes:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. The function get_viewXreplies_elements() from previous versions is depecrated,\n",
    "#    as the CSS selector for \"View [x] replies\" buttons is no longer \"#more-text\".\n",
    "#    The CSS selector is now simply \"#text\", which is shared with many other elements\n",
    "#    on the page. To filter out which elements actually correspond to \"View [x] replies\",\n",
    "#    the RegEx \"(View).*(repl).*\" is used to match against each found element.text.\n",
    "#    Elements whose text field matches the RegEx are then added to the actual list of\n",
    "#    \"View [x] replies\" elements.\n",
    "# 2. Changed function get_ShowMoreReplies_elements() to check if found elements' text\n",
    "#    field is equal to \"Show more replies\". If it does match, the element is then\n",
    "#    added to the actual list of \"Show more replies\" elements. This modification is\n",
    "#    similar to the one mentioned above, except without the use of a RegEx pattern.\n",
    "# 3. Added funtion to make list of sources for output\n",
    "#    where len(sources) = len(comments) and all items are the same source, \"YouTube\".\n",
    "# 4. Changed output column names to be all lowercase and without whitespace, as follows:\n",
    "#    - \"My Comment ID\" -> \"my_comment_id\"\n",
    "#    - \"source\"\n",
    "#    - \"Video Title\" -> \"video_title\"\n",
    "#    - \"Username\" -> \"username\"\n",
    "#    - \"Comment\" -> \"comment\"\n",
    "#    - \"Timestamp\" -> \"timestamp\"\n",
    "#    - \"Timestamp Number\" -> \"timestamp_number\"\n",
    "#    - \"Timestamp Unit\" -> \"timestamp_unit\"\n",
    "#    - \"Edited\" -> \"edited\"\n",
    "#    - \"Upvotes\" -> \"upvotes\"\n",
