<h1>2: <em><span style="color: green">+.424</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Now fit my friend size XL recieve yesterday</mark></p>
<h1>3: <em><span style="color: green">+.225</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Maybe a little thinner than I expected....</mark> <mark class = "pos">Still love it though!!!!</mark></p>
<h1>4: <em><span style="color: green">+.633</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Love it, wearing it right now.</mark></p>
<h1>5: <em><span style="color: green">+.367</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Material isn't what I expected. <mark class = "pos">I was expecting a better quality fit and material</mark></p>
<h1>6: <em><span style="color: green">+.430</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This top is fantastic, lovely warm material that's not too thick to be able to wear under a jacket.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great colour and I love the thumb hooks in the sleeves that are a nice length for people with long arms.</mark> Would definitely buy from this seller again. <mark class = "pos">Great price , well worth the money.</mark> Thankyou</p>
<h1>7: <em><span style="color: green">+.284</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Quite a bright pink, not baby pink, and what looks like mottled/grey material in the picture is just plain off white.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Material is also much thinner than expected.</mark> Not very long if your tall.</p>
<h1>8: <em><span style="color: green">+.650</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Love these super comfy, lovely material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Perfect lockdown wear!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a UK20 and 2xl fits perfectly.</mark></p>
<h1>9: <em><span style="color: green">+.430</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good quality nice soft material
Fits as expected XXL suits size 20.</mark> Ok for wearing at home and for going out.</p>
<h1>10: <em><span style="color: green">+.683</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The trousers are slightly too big, but are very comfortable, they're very soft and the quality of fabric is actually better than what you can see at the photos.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The tie string is not black, it's actually cream/white, but it doesn't bother me that much.</mark> <mark class = "pos">May be getting a smaller pair in the future, but I want to see how durable this pair is.</mark></p>
<h1>11: <em><span style="color: green">+1.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Brilliant</mark></p>
<h1>12: <em><span style="color: green">+.436</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Joggers came quickly, very comfy to wear around the house.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like that the cuff rests on my ankle.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The only downside is that they lose shape quickly and knee.</mark></p>
<h1>13: <em><span style="color: green">+.235</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">So so comfortable and soft.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Hard to find jogging bottoms in plus sizes that are not extortionate or "straight leg" or "bootcut".</mark> <mark class = "pos">Being fat doesn't mean I dislike the elastic ankle joggers, I'd rather look my fat size than look like I'm dressing myself in a tent.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Would recommend.</mark></p>
<h1>14: <em><span style="color: green">+.867</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I bought these as I couldn't find anything else to fit me as I am alot larger than normal due to lots of medication but I'm so glad I did they are the right fit, comfortable, cosy and excellent for the price in fact there so good I now have 2 pairs of each colour just wish they did more colours I would buy them 2.</mark></p>
<h1>15: <em><span style="color: green">+.358</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Love these joggers, fitted perfectly and feel great on.</mark> So much so I've decided to buy a second pair.</p>
<h1>16: <em><span style="color: green">+.413</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I bought these for slobbing about at home and they definitely fulfil that purpose. <mark class = "pos">A little bigger than I needed, but still comfy and soft - perfect for post-shower when you're not quite ready to go for PJs yet.</mark></p>
<h1>17: <em><span style="color: green">+.264</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are honestly amazing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a size 16/18, I got the smallest size available the 2X, and they are perfect for if you want a loose super comfy pair of lounge around the house pants!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are a little bit roomy on me, but the draw strings actually work (not one of those fake ones), they are fleece lined AND have pockets!!</mark> üòç</p>
<h1>18: <em><span style="color: green">+.965</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great product comfortable to wear value for money fast delivery thankyou .</mark></p>
<h1>19: <em><span style="color: green">+.908</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Very comfortable fit, lovely soft material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very pleased - would buy again</mark></p>
<h1>20: <em><span style="color: green">+.626</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Comfortable with great deep pockets.</mark></p>
<h1>21: <em><span style="color: green">+.249</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">During the current covid 19 crisis I am working from home and wanted some comfy clothes to sit and answer calls in.</mark> So, long story short, I decided to look for some sweaters. <mark class = "pos">Good old Amazon basics came up trumps with this one - it's a good size nice and baggy and comfy and has a fleece lining and is absolutely perfect for what I wanted- so what else could I do but buy some more in different colours - needs must when you're working at home!!</mark></p>
<h1>22: <em><span style="color: green">+.408</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Excellent could live it
In it</mark></p>
<h1>23: <em><span style="color: green">+.389</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I bought three of these and was very happy with the colours, material and fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The sizing was spot on and I was surprised how soft they were for the price.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They do fit straight through the body though, no bagginess.</mark></p>
<h1>24: <em><span style="color: green">+.337</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Lovely fabric.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Soft and warm.</mark> It shrinks a bit in the wash though. <mark class = "pos">I found the grey sweatshirts to made of less stretchy fabric.</mark></p>
<h1>25: <em><span style="color: green">+.690</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The product was very good and fitted as expected</mark></p>
<h1>26: <em><span style="color: green">+.500</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Comfortable</mark></p>
<h1>27: <em><span style="color: green">+.919</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good style, nice finish, comfy fabric</mark></p>
<h1>28: <em><span style="color: green">+.112</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">It was far too big</mark></p>
<h1>29: <em><span style="color: green">+.424</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Soft fabric</mark></p>
<h1>30: <em><span style="color: green">+.380</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I am a 14/16 and I ordered L. <mark class = "pos">They fit beautifully.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am quite tall 5ft 8" and they are a lovely length and are high waisted.</mark> <mark class = "pos">SO when I get confident enough I can run in a sports bra and my new leggings :D A very happy customer and will definitely order more</mark></p>
<h1>31: <em><span style="color: green">+.567</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really nice quality leggings.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Thick enough to not to become see through when stretching.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Will buy the brand again as the prices are very reasonable.</mark></p>
<h1>32: <em><span style="color: green">+.262</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are super comfy and the pattern looks really good!</mark> However the waist is a bit baggy and can slip a little when working out. <mark class = "pos">They can also be quite warm and a little too sweaty because the fabric isnt so breathable.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I really like them but I don't necessarily recommend them for rigourous working out.</mark></p>
<h1>33: <em><span style="color: green">+.260</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great leggings, don't fall down and are actually quite flattering around the stomach.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wished all leggings fit like this!</mark></p>
<h1>34: <em><span style="color: green">+1.453</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Comfy good quality wahes great</mark></p>
<h1>35: <em><span style="color: green">+.433</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">They're just perfect.</mark></p>
<h1>36: <em><span style="color: green">+.864</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really comfy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Fall down a bit but not enough to be bothered.</mark></p>
<h1>37: <em><span style="color: green">+.574</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great leggings.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit well and are very flattering</mark></p>
<h1>38: <em><span style="color: green">+.241</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are really a great fit, dont roll down and look good too</mark></p>
<h1>39: <em><span style="color: green">+.144</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">They are fine 5</mark></p>
<h1>40: <em><span style="color: green">+.990</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Ideal fit</mark></p>
<h1>41: <em><span style="color: green">+.160</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I received these in a size large which I would say was accurate for a size 14.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The pair I received for review were the same as the photograph but the pattern was in turquoise blue and not white.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The only colour option appears to be 'black' so it's unclear why I have a pair in a different colour than the images.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The waistband is wide and high, a style which I prefer (i.e. rather than a waistband that sits lower and more on the true waist).</mark> <mark class = "pos">The higher waist allows for more comfort for me and an easier style to exercise in.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is thick and smoothing, definitely more flattering to a fuller figure than some exercise leggings can be.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The only improvement that I would make is for a drawstring to be added to the waist.</mark></p>
<h1>42: <em><span style="color: green">+.098</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These leggings look lovely when they are on and are very stretchy, so perfect for time in the gym or on a run or any other exercise!</mark> <mark class = "neg">They were not so good for yoga though as I prefer softer fabric for yoga sessions.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is stretchy and feels like Lycra to the touch.</mark> They come up small so I suggest going for a larger size then you normally wear. <mark class = "neg">I'm fairly tall and they aren't long enough for me, so if you're tall opt for a different set of leggings.</mark></p>
<h1>43: <em><span style="color: green">+.716</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Very good quality with a cool vibrant print.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great for general workouts and book camps.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Not the new trendy mesh leggings but if you want something well made, functional, good fit and has a funky pattern then these are great.</mark> It's not LuLuLemon but neither is the price. <mark class = "pos">Definitely recommended if you're NOT a fashion victim.</mark></p>
<h1>44: <em><span style="color: green">+.530</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These sports leggings are

<h1>61: <em><span style="color: green">+.329</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Good quality slightly a bit too big but I am in between sizes so that could be my bad.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Lovely design nice feel material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Overall very impressed</mark></p>
<h1>62: <em><span style="color: green">+.138</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I have 4 of these bras in a variety of colours.</mark> <mark class = "pos">By far the best sports bras I have ever owner.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I do a lot of HIIT and plyo and this keeps my F cups supported and under control!</mark></p>

<h1>67: <em><span style="color: red">-.299</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Comfortable, but not the best fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">A little too big.</mark></p>
<h1>68: <em><span style="color: green">+.213</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The cup size is OK.however the fitting is quite tight.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Normally I'm a size 36 and I would go probably a size up if I was to purchase another one.</mark></p>
<h1>69: <em><span style="color: green">+.530</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Perfect hold</mark></p>
<h1>70: <em><span style="color: green">+.479</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Well fitted, supportive and comfortable sports bra.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a 38C and found it fitted well with good coverage.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I struggle with some halter back bras as they dig into my shoulders- and even this one with the straps clipped together is less comfortable for me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Knocked one star off for it being the creakiest bra I've ever had- plastic rings attaching straps to the back make a right racket whenever you move!</mark></p>
<h1>71: <em><span style="color: green">+.147</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Just ordered my second one.... <mark class = "neg">first one has been to hell and back and I have the shape to prove it.</mark> ... <mark class = "pos">after 6 yrs it's getting squeaky but still looks new after 100 machine washes.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The only bra for me in sport or leisure .!</mark></p>

<h1>74: <em><span style="color: green">+.439</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The top feels soft, light and is very comfortable to wear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">There is no irritation from wearing it like you do get sometimes from vests/tank tops.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Recommended.</mark></p>
<h1>75: <em><span style="color: green">+.559</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great colour's and good size.</mark></p>

<h1>81: <em><span style="color: green">+.237</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Just what I wanted, a longer, loose top for Pilates.</mark></p>
<h1>82: <em><span style="color: green">+.118</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">somewhat sheer, nice soft material however doesn't feel particularly cooling, its a warm fabric (if that makes sense?)</mark></p>
<h1>83: <em><span style="color: green">+1.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Nice, comfortable casual top.</mark></p>
<h1>84: <em><span style="color: red">-.133</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Very thin material. Seam came apart after first time of wearing it. Had to go in the bin. <mark class = "neg">Not happy</mark></p>

<h1>87: <em><span style="color: red">-.305</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Being tall and large busted I thought thi top would be great for the gym.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I wan't expecting a lot for the price, but I knew the material wasn't breathable sports wear, and I know I would have felt uncomfortable and very hot wearing it.</mark></p>
<h1>88: <em><span style="color: red">-.024</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These leggings are the most comfortable leggings I have ever worn!</mark> <mark class = "pos">As a plus size lady with health and mobility issues, I was looking for something that would be comfortable and provide support whilst being practical and flattering.</mark> I believe these certainly tick all these boxes. <mark class = "neg">As a Fibromyalgia sufferer, pain and discomfort is part of everyday living for me.</mark> <mark class = "neg">These leggings provided enough support without applying too much pressure to cause an increase in pain.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material is also magic as despite being thick and supportive it did not make me feel hot and sticky.</mark> I will be ordering more but my size is put off stock atm. (I'm a size 18-20 and bought size XL).</p>
<h1>89: <em><span style="color: green">+.168</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I am a size 16 and ordered the XL size which fitted me perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have started the couch to 5k and they are very comfortable to run in.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material feels nice against your skin.</mark> Would definitely buy another pair.</p>
<h1>90: <em><span style="color: green">+.260</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I bought those leggins cos they had good reviews.</mark> <mark class = "neg">But the material is horrible.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are comfy and fit me perfectly, better than expected, but I've just used them three times and they already look very old, especially the side seams, they started to tousle.</mark> <mark class = "pos">For the price, primark leggins are much better and cheaper</mark></p>
<h1>91: <em><span style="color: green">+.082</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I am a size 18 and these were just slightly tight. <mark class = "pos">They very well made so being as I am on a weight loss plan I am keeping them.</mark> I will order another pair</p>
<h1>92: <em><span style="color: green">+.552</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great leggings, perfect fit, true to size, stretchy comfortable and do not roll down.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Love them.</mark></p>

<h1>159: <em><span style="color: red">-.011</span></em></h1><p class="indented">So I ordered these yoga pants for their high waist and thick material. I spend most of my yoga sessions pulling up my leggings after every move. <mark class = "neg">I also forget to match my underwear with my leggings on occasions.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These fit lovely and have a great feel to them, which I was thrilled about, as some leggings/pants can be uncomfortable.</mark> <mark class = "neg">However the massive drawback to these yoga pants, is the length of them.</mark> My height is 5ft 2in and attached is how much material is at the bottom of my feet. <mark class = "neg">There is way too much material and it looks silly.</mark> Questions for the seller, do you assume that everyone is 6ft? <mark class = "pos">Do you cater for the shorter lady, that doesn't mean petite, as some companies then assume petite means you bum and tum as well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Sorry not in my case, as I've had 3 kids and I'm working on my belly!</mark> Short means in height and equals less material. <mark class = "pos">If you do not offer a shorter range then maybe this should be considered, as pretty much most of the people in my yoga class, including the instructor's height is below 5ft 5in.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Apart from that I love them and I am gutted I will have to send them back.</mark></p>

<h1>323: <em><span style="color: green">+.056</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The bra overall bra seems fine but it was not really a plus size item.</mark> <mark class = "neg">When it arrived I didn't see the extender to start with and was very disappointed it seemed far too small.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The extender does make it fit more comfortably.</mark> <mark class = "neg">For a sports bra, I was disappointed the straps won't stay put and have no hook to clip them together which comes as standard on most sports bras.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You get what you pay for and it seems to be a pretty good bra for the price.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I will continue to wear it for the gym for the next couple of weeks to see how it holds up after a couple of washes.</mark></p>

<h1>327: <em><span style="color: green">+.314</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I haven't had a chance to use it yet but the fit itself (34F) is perfect and it felt very secure.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Rating it for the fit alone hence the four star.</mark></p>
<h1>328: <em><span style="color: green">+.178</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I would recommend going up a size as it does come up rather small.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The extender does help but to be on safe side go up.</mark> So if you're a 34g I'd get the 36h. <mark class = "pos">Other than size being slightly confusing overall it's very comfortable and holds the girls in place with a heavy workout</mark></p>
<h1>329: <em><span style="color: green">+.482</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Better than a bra twice the price I recently bought.</mark> Managed a HIIT session without a bounce. <mark class = "pos">I'm usually 32H but found 34G fitted perfectly.</mark></p>

<h1>331: <em><span style="color: green">+.065</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Usually buy shock absorbers brand but you're looking at £40 plus.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It seems a rip off.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Read the reviews on this well priced sports bra and I was not disappointed.</mark> In fact thinking about buying another. The back is very small so I ordered a 34 instead of a 32. I still needed the expander which they send with it. <mark class = "pos">It gives loads of support.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Recommended.</mark></p>
<h1>332: <em><span style="color: green">+.237</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">For the price it is very good.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However even though I ordered a back size bigger (after reading other reviews) I still have to use the back extender.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Reason for four stars not five is that by having to use the extender the support isn't as good as it would be without it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Still a good buy though.</mark></p>
<h1>333: <em><span style="color: red">-.250</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">No bounce great product</mark></p>

<h1>341: <em><span style="color: red">-.422</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Absolutely disgusting excuse for sizing.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I ordered the size up just incase as I had heard all the bad reviews about their product being too small, I was shocked at how off this was from 34 G.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Do not purchase from this company.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The sizing is ridicoulous I don't know what they're using to reference sizing but it's abhorrent.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Material of the bra is terrible as well and I doubt it'd be able to support anything.</mark></p>
<h1>342: <em><span style="color: green">+.743</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I'm a 34G and this bra fits perfectly with fantastic support.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Good quality and excellent value for money.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It has washed really well and shall be buying another soon.</mark></p>

<h1>345: <em><span style="color: red">-.046</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Honestly when I first looked at this bra I was very sceptical.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Being a 34H makes it almost impossible to buy a normal bra, let alone a sports bra.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However I must say that this bra is absolutely brilliant and I would urge anyone who is large on the bust to invest in the bra.</mark> I ran on a tredmil with this bra... And guess what?! <mark class = "pos">NO BLACK EYES!!!</mark> <mark class = "neg">P.s also didn't hurt whilst running either (hallelujah!)</mark></p>

<h1>347: <em><span style="color: green">+.313</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Extremely pleased.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So far best sports bra I have tried.</mark> <mark class = "neg">As a fuller busted lady, working out hard, but this bra keeps it all in!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Nice touch with the bra extender included.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The price is amazing also.</mark></p>
<h1>348: <em><span style="color: green">+.314</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Was a bit sceptical about buying this product after reading some of the bad reviews but thought for the price I'll give it a go and I'm glad I did, ok it's not got underwire and the material isn't top range, but it does the job and I am more than pleased with it.</mark> I ordered the same size back to my everyday bra but 2 sizes bigger in the cup. <mark class = "pos">It comes with an extender for the back which is great.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I would recommend and definitely order again.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great purchase.</mark></p>
<h1>349: <em><span style="color: green">+.154</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I don't usually buy bras on line because they often don't fit and it's a hassle to send back but I was pleased to find that this bra fits well.</mark> There are no bulges.

<h1>451: <em><span style="color: green">+.076</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Arrived really promptly.</mark> Needed the extender to get it on. Once on it's very firm control.

<h1>452: <em><span style="color: green">+.105</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I'm accustomed to Panache Sport and this is a similar shape but much more like the Shock Absorber in terms of support and wear.</mark> I usually wear a 34H and bought it in a 36H due to all the comments suggesting sister sizing. <mark class = "pos">My cups are a little flattened but I'm happy enough with the size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">As for support, I definitely wouldn't wear this for high impact like running, I'll stick to the Panache underwired for that, but for a gym session this bra was ideal.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Lightweight, not padded and comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">And I thought it was cheaper than a lot of it's competitors so I'll be buying again.</mark></p>
<h1>453: <em><span style="color: green">+.242</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The bra is too small around the support and at back.</mark> <mark class = "pos">BUT an extender was placed in the packaging and so fits perfectly for sport.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I am a difficult size to fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But very good for the price and the material is good.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Would pass as medium impact bra for my size bust.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Would recommend especially for the price.</mark></p>

<h1>455: <em><span style="color: red">-.144</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">So disappointed!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I ordered a 36J and whilst the cup was great (ordered a size bigger than normal) it was not 36", despite what the label said!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I measured it and was only 30", perhaps 31" if a little stretch was applied to the band.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Such a shame as seemed really good otherwise.</mark></p>
<h1>456: <em><span style="color: green">+.206</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Great for and love it doesn't have wires.</mark> I wear and wash this 3/4 times a week. <mark class = "pos">Excellent product</mark></p>

For your back and you can adjust the shoulder straps to pull up too!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Value for money.</mark> I usually spend double on my Bras. <mark class = "pos">I'm glad I read all of the reviews, I usually find it difficult to find bras that will pass the jump test, are tight enough, and comfortable - (I'll be using it for daily exercise.) This ticks those boxes - Just ensure you SIZE UP. I bought the biggest cup they have 'J' and went up a size in my back to a 38J (I'm usually around a 36K in normal bras) .</mark> <mark class = "pos">without the extra strap it's a little tight, but I lose the hold if I add the extender as my back is a smaller ratio to my cup (nice to know it's there anyway)

Cons: there is a very slight spillage on the side and the top bulges just slightly.</mark> <mark class = "neg">But nothing too bad.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I may just to wear a light material sports bra over this one (I've previously worn 3 at one time, so again not a problem).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great buy overall for price, coverage, comfort And hold - I'm sure it'll pass the run test and if it does, I'll buy another :)</mark></p>

I used the extender this morning, this made the design worse, far too big and offered zero support.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I wouldn't therefore recommend this particular plain version at all.</mark></p>

<h1>911: <em><span style="color: green">+.132</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Having read the reviews I decided to order my usual bra size 44G.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Adjusting the shoulder straps to approx 1inch tighter and using the extender around the back it fits perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am hoping to lose weight and therefore it will still fit for longer and I will buy again once üòÉ</mark></p>

<h1>940: <em><span style="color: green">+.115</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">As someone who is on the far end of the scale when it comes to breast size (being a J-K cup, depending on the bra), buying new bras is always a pain in the neck, because you can be sure you're never going to get something that fits 100% perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "neg">This is the case with this bra in the beginning, as there was some minor overflow to begin with, but after a few days of wearing this bra to stretch it out, I have very little complaints!</mark> <mark class = "pos">This is the most supportive bra I have ever owned, and though it doesn't 100% stop movement (though at larger cup sizes, this is almost impossible), I feel both comfortable and secure.</mark> <mark class = "pos">As other reviews have said, as far as band size goes, this bra is a very, very narrow fit, but thankfully you are provided with a free extender, and with this extender the bra fits perfectly!</mark> <mark class = "neg">However, if you are worried about the extender breaking in the long run and would rather just have the bra fitting by itself, I would recommend sizing up before you buy.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I am extremely happy with the cut of the bra also - the high sides and thick back straps get rid of the pesky side-boob and back fat issues extremely well, and now my shirts no longer make me look like a cake tin that has been overfilled.</mark> <mark class = "pos">There are some other minor issues, like loose threads and the stitching of the bra showing through tighter shirts, but all in all I am very pleased with my purchase, and will definitely be buying another one or two of these bras!</mark> <mark class = "pos">TL,DR: band sizing is small, so size up when buying, larger busted people may have an issue with overflow but this is fine after the bra is stretched out, bra gives wonderful support and the thick straps get rid of back fat and side boob -would 100% recommend!</mark></p>
<h1>941: <em><span style="color: green">+.062</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I ordered a 44J and I would say it was true to size. <mark class = "neg">If you don't like it too tight then the expander with it will help.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Needless to say with my boobs I needed everything strapped in.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Being the size I am, I'm never going to eliminate all the movement but it did make a big difference.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I used to wear a running jacket to hide my bouncy boobs as I was self conscious, but today confidently went out in a t-shirt.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I think it's excellent value for money and will be ordering another</mark></p>
<h1>942: <em><span style="color: green">+.657</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really lovely and soft but strong material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very happy with this bra, needing such a large cup was really important that the bra was able to give me the support I needed, and this does.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Would happily recommend this bra to anyone.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You won't be disappointed in this sports bra, in fact it's so comfortable you could wear it all the time and not just for sports.</mark></p>

<h1>1016: <em><span style="color: green">+.163</span></em></h1><p class="indented">It fits. It really fits. <mark class = "pos">It fits so well, I'm shocked.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wanted more razor back sports bras for ages, but could never find my size or ones with straps that weren't suitable for a giraffe.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I have a drawer full of ones that will NEVER fit, or will have had once I fill a rubbish bag with them.</mark> Let me tell you about these FITTIN bras. <mark class = "pos">They arrived super fast, packaged in zip pouches (bonus for sanitary!) and were in pristine condition.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Initially I ordered two in green (lovely forest green colour), but liked them so much I ordered them again in the four pack option.</mark> They too were each exactly alike in style and packaged in a zipped pouch of four. <mark class = "pos">All the stitching on every one is properly done and neatly, with reinforcement stitching on pressure points.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The inserts are easy to remove and the insert panel provides a second layer on the front -which is where a double layer is appreciated.</mark> <mark class = "pos">And no, without the padding, there is no nips showing problem.</mark> :)
I laundered all of them in 30C wash in bio gel. <mark class = "pos">The dye did not run; I added an old white pillowcase to the wash to check.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The garment shape did not alter, skew or shrink and the stitching did not come undone.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I line dried two (2 hours), and tumble dried on low (20 min) the others.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Again, the bras did not shrink or skew, the stitching remained intact and the fabric surface did not pill.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These are old school quality, a rare find in the current disposable clothing market.</mark> <mark class = "pos">And they fit like they're supposed to fit.</mark> <mark class = "neg">No side or top spillage, and only a slight mono arrangement of the girls.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These bras are not tight or restrictive, but comfortably snug; the fabric is soft and not scratchy and after a 14 hour wear still heroically doing their job :) and not binding or awkwardly rubbing on any point.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In fact, they're so comfortable they were as remote in my thoughts as my ex.</mark> <mark class = "neg">:D
These are medium impact sports bras, so there is some bounce, making them not ideal for athletic adventures.</mark> <mark class = "neg">In all honesty, at 38G, something industrial would be needed for athletics, but the technology hasn't yet been invented.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are fine for sleep bras, lounging bras or everyday wear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Did I use the seller's size guide?</mark> <mark class = "pos">YES!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Do I like these bras?</mark> <mark class = "pos">No, I love them and am super happy to have found this listing from this seller.</mark></p>

<h1>1019: <em><span style="color: green">+.549</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I did end up buying a to small a size which is a shame cause te colours are pretty and different from the plain black and white sports bra through I did like how they give you them as opinions to wear as well but I am still giving 5 stars as the quality was very good and felt well structured to keep your boobs in just a shame mine were to small to find out.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They came very quickly and it was free to send back when I needed a refund the people as well were helpful and very friendly when sorting my request for me but I think I'm going to stick to buying bras at a shop then online.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Do give these a try just make sure to get the right size or go up one as I thought I had and turned out I still got it to small for me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Like I said is a shame cause I would of kept them if they had fit me and properly have done the job with holding my boobs secure when moving and working out.</mark></p>
<h1>1020: <em><span style="color: green">+.296</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I've been looking for a comfy bra for ages that also includes a bit of support as well so I can wear it under tshirts without my boobs drooping/looking weird.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a 38/40D (DD sometimes) and first went for an XXL which was too large for any support but was comfy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I reordered the XL and it was better support wise.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's still not supportive enough for sport or anything like that but it works as something to throw on under your top if you're popping to the shops or something.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I took out the pads as well as they gave my breasts a weird shape.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material does stretch a bit so I sometimes have to readjust to keep the support in place.</mark></p>
<h1>1021: <em><span style="color: green">+.102</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Bought this for jogging, bought the XL for 38DD. Fits quite tightly but as a sports bra this is expected. <mark class = "pos">Unfortunately I don't think it's suitable for high impact (reason for 3 stars).</mark> <mark class = "neg">However it is comfortable and will be used just not for anything high impact , more suited for walking/ yoga / cycling.</mark></p>

<h1>1202: <em><span style="color: green">+.140</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Ordered for exercise class, being rather large chested and couldn't find anything in UK shops I turned to amazon. <mark class = "pos">This bra is great, it supports like a minimiser bra and I haven't had any problems with aching so yes I recommend it for us larger ladies.</mark></p>
<h1>1203: <em><span style="color: green">+.158</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">It's nice and fits but it is not 'no bounce'</mark></p>

<h1>1210: <em><span style="color: green">+.068</span></em></h1><p class="indented">One of my favourite sports bras to use when doing high impact sports. I have nearly zero bounce! And if I double it up with a normal sports bra then I have no bounce at all. <mark class = "neg">I have used it for running outdoor and on the treadmill and also for doing Insanity workout DVDs.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have had this bra in two different sizes, 42E when I was larger and now a 40DD, I can still use the 42E with another sports bra on top and have zero bounce!</mark> <mark class = "pos">The only problem is the straps slipping a little but its adjustable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have found this product to be very true to size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The product is all fabric, so no nasty underwires snapping and digging into you, it absorbs sweat really quickly but doesn't harbour bad odours and it's really easy to wash.</mark></p>

<h1>1238: <em><span style="color: green">+.215</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This is my second sports bra from this company (FYI, their regular nonwired ones are very comfy too).</mark> <mark class = "pos">I had the delight of getting to try one for free as part of the Vine programme and it's SO good I had to buy another because it definitely is one of my comfiest undergarments that I always forget I'm wearing (and for big girls, we know that's a hard thing to find).</mark> <mark class = "pos">I use it for not just exercise but for general use - I bought it two size down at the band so can have a slightly tighter back size for exercise as a deliberate measure for keeping the boulders bolstered down (if you're a big girl, this actually does make a difference, it'll dig in at any back fat, but will give less bounce at the front - on me it is tight but NOT uncomfortable enough to restrict movement or hurt) then use an elasticated bra extender for normal every day wear so it's comfy (and with the extender it is VERY comfy - in fact, I literally can't feel it).</mark> <mark class = "pos">It has a "modesty" patch at the collar section to hide your cleavage, which I love.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I'm bigger busted and I honestly hate that most sports bras push the "girls" together and then UP so that everyone sees, but this bra allows for separation while giving you a bit of modesty so your bust isn't on display - nice if your sports tops are low cut.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Washes very easy, dries quite fast.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Doesn't have a lot of stretch except at the straps, obviously (essential if you want good support and don't want the band sliding).</mark> <mark class = "pos">What I do love is that for a sports bra it doesn't give you a weird shape.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It doesn't flatten your bust down or push them into one weird looking mound (like the over the head ones do), it doesn't push them up to your chin so that it looks like you're suffocating -it keeps them separate and breast-shaped (although the longer you wear and depending on how you're moving, they will eventually together and give you cleavage but this usually happens with most standard bras anyway).</mark> <mark class = "pos">For some reason although I'm a G, in this particular bra I'm a DD (I haven't been a DD since high school), can't explain it as a DD isn't the sister size for a G, but it fits superbly and my bazookas aren't squished at all.</mark> <mark class = "neg">You might need to look hard at measurements when it comes to sizing as you might find another size is actually your "sports bra" sister sizing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Worth a look.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This might be considered expensive for a sports bra but a good bra is an investment, especially a comfy one that you need to withstand impact.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This isn't the kind of bra you have for half the year, wear twice and then dump, this is a solid piece of foundation garmentry that should last you a few years (like my other has).</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's worth spending on merely because you get what you pay for sometimes and I know that from experience.</mark> <mark class = "neg">A discount sports shop over the head one or cheap fashion shop zip up one won't compare to this quality.</mark> Invest in your sports bras. <mark class = "pos">Definitely recommend it, especially to the larger busted lady who struggles finding that right sports bra that doesn't hurt.</mark></p>

<h1>2168: <em><span style="color: red">-.079</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Not the best running bra for support. <mark class = "pos">I read the reviews on here before purchase but I don't think it gives as much support as the shock absorber that is recommended for running (via their chart).</mark> <mark class = "neg">I went a size up, but after an hour it leaves very tight marks under bust.</mark> It's ok for cycling in but won't be using it for running. <mark class = "neg">I'm a larger busted lady, but it probably wud be ok for smaller ladies.</mark></p>

Have ordered more.</p>
<h1>2175: <em><span style="color: green">+.023</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The bra in itself is good - comfortable and supportive as it claims to be.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I have a grouse though - about the packaging.</mark> <mark class = "pos">One day when i got home i found a slip from the postman saying he couldnt deliver an item as it was to large to put through the letter box.</mark> I decided to walk into town in the rain to the P.O. depot. <mark class = "pos">I was intrigued as to what it was going to be.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I knew it couldnt be the bra I'd ordered or the violin strings if it was too big for my letter box.</mark> <mark class = "neg">When i got to the depot I was given a cardboard box, light as a feather but large enough to hold a frying pan.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I still didnt believe it was the bra until I opened the box and worked my way through the inventive and painstaking packaging materials.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The bra itself can be folded and fit into my jeans pocket, the packaging will have to be dissembled before I fill my recycling bag with it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I consider it a waste of time , energy and materials and I'm sure the postman would agree.</mark></p>
<h1>2176: <em><span style="color: green">+.251</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The bra is of a good quality.</mark> However, I had to send it back as it was too small and I bought a full two sizes bigger than I normally buy! <mark class = "neg">It was such a shame that the straps around the back were too small and would not join up.</mark> I tried to order another size up but they didn't have the cup size I needed. <mark class = "pos">Please order MUCH BIGGER sizes than you think you need.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It would then be worth it as it was a quality bra.</mark></p>

<h1>2178: <em><span style="color: green">+.040</span></em></h1><p class="indented">This bra certainly does what it says on the tin! Once enclosed within it, there is no way that you will be going anywhere!! <mark class = "pos">It keeps everything tightly in place and is very comfortable to jump around during my daily exercise.</mark> The straps are wider and slightly padded so they dont 'dig in'. <mark class = "neg">The only negative I have is that I use the last hooks to fasten the bra and it is 'really' tight below my bust and around my back.</mark> But I suppose you cant have it both ways! <mark class = "pos">I would recommend this sports bra for exercise but wouldnt wear it casually (!)</mark></p>

<h1>2257: <em><span style="color: green">+.285</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I bought this bra in the hope that it would fit comfortably and provide support, and be easy to put on and take off.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am pleased to say it is all those things!</mark> <mark class = "pos">It has nice thick straps which are cushioned and comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It has to be snug fitting in order to do its job, so I admit I have to do it up at the front and then twist it round before putting the straps on, but that is really easy to do.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am blessed with a chest and find that everything stays where it should when I go running.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like the way it is cut quite high too, so peeps out of my V-neck T shirt kind of like a modesty panel.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This also gives extra absorbency.</mark> It is also really comfortable and I forget that I am wearing it. <mark class = "pos">It gives a great shape too so I would be happy to wear this all day if I was going to the gym after work.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am very pleased with this product and will be back to buy more.</mark></p>

<h1>2263: <em><span style="color: green">+.087</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I'm an F cup, been using this for running, keeps everything steady.</mark> Used it so much I've now gone down a size so I've had to buy another in a size down.</p>

<h1>2272: <em><span style="color: green">+.324</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The bra fits well and gives fantastic support during aerobic exercise classes.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The wide shoulder straps are comfortable and the padding under the hook and eye fastening prevents any rubbing or discomfort.</mark></p>
<h1>2273: <em><span style="color: red">-.026</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The bra is fine, and is a good fit.</mark> <mark class = "neg">However, the hooks are really weak and bend easily, making it tricky - especially when trying to put it on in a rush in a busy changing room!</mark></p>
<h1>2274: <em><span style="color: red">-.021</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The cup fitted perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The bra is very tight but is baggy at the front where it has been over stretched when constructing but this does not prevent the support.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Overall great for workout of an hour but would be uncomfortable to wear any longer.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Very hard to find a bra that fits my size having larger breasts and finding comfort and support and not so granny looking.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It does the job but I will be looking for more comfort.</mark></p>
<h1>2275: <em><span style="color: green">+.206</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">This bra looks nice and seems to be well made but the back strap would not reach at all, nowhere near, in fact inches out.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have just ordered 3 bras from another site in the same size 38F and they fit perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am returning the bra, sadly, as it looks good, but I cannot even begin to guess what size I would have to buy to go round me.</mark></p>

<h1>2277: <em><span style="color: green">+.314</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This is brilliant, I love it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I would never buy any other sports bras, I've tried so many over the years and in my opinion these are far far superior.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love the fit, and it's much easier to put on than previous shock absorbers I've had, because it's just made like an ordinary bra without the crossover back.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love this so much and it's just enabled me to do my best run in years, so comfortably.</mark> I'm buying another. Some reviewers have criticised the sizing. <mark class = "pos">I ordered a cup size smaller than I would normally wear, from previous experience that works best with sports bras.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It fits me perfectly.</mark></p>
<h1>2278: <em><span style="color: green">+.472</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">this is the third bra i have like this .</mark> <mark class = "pos">i find them so supportive for my larger figure .</mark> <mark class = "pos">brilliant .</mark></p>

<h1>2410: <em><span style="color: green">+.032</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I ordered a 40F and it feels a bit tight around the ribs. <mark class = "pos">I don't know if this is because I've gained even more weight since buying my normal every day bra, or if my everyday bra has been stretched out over the years, or if sports bras are naturally gonna be a bit tighter to keep everything firm and in place.</mark> It does the job tho. I can use my trampoline at last!</p>
<h1>2411: <em><span style="color: green">+.330</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I was sceptical wken purchasing this item as the negatives were apparently it's poor sizing but went ahead and to my surprise it's an amazing bra!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a 40F so I ordered a 40F and it fits perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "neg">When I opened it my initial thoughts were oh my goodness that looks flimsy there's no way that will provide me with the support I need but upon trying it on I realised looks were very deceiving.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm very pleased with the item and will be purchasing another one.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It offers good support for bigger busted women and it's very comfortable indeed - very happy customer!</mark></p>

<h1>2491: <em><span style="color: green">+.208</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These bras are the best I have ever purchased.</mark> I have just purchased another 2. <mark class = "pos">They are fantastic, so comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am large chested 42 DD and they fit perfectly but what I have to do and it is the same with any bra I purchase is to make the straps shorter because I am short from the shoulders to the top of my breasts so I have to take in about 2 ins of strap every time I purchase a bra, even the underwired normal bras, I unpick the strap cut 2 ins off and re-sew it.</mark> <mark class = "neg">That ensures my bust is lifted higher.</mark> <mark class = "pos">What I will do with these soft bras is put the straps together, cut off 2 ins and re-sew them and I will then have full support and my bust will be higher.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit perfectly at the back and I love the wide band underneath plus the pads in the bra which you can take out if you don't need them.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I will leave them in until I shorten the straps and then try it without them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Wonderful.</mark></p>

I am a size DD and had no issues going out with the dog or visiting relative in hospital wearing this.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They smooth lumps and bumps and give just enough support to feel confident in wearing them outside of the house.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you are recovering from an operation in this area i think these would be a good option, or if you are on holiday with the In-Laws.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love this product!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I have been looking for this for many years now and have accidentally happened across it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Highly recommend.</mark></p>

<h1>2495: <em><span style="color: green">+.493</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good fit, I probably should if ordered a smaller size although went for this as I'm an f and pregnant, there's not much support but definitely would be in the smaller size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Really comfy and gives a great shape.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I've had some cheap ones from eBay beofre that I sleep in and had to get a larger size in those and the cup size still wasn't big enough, but these bras are plenty bug enough for f cups and hoping they last once the milk comes in too</mark></p>

<h1>2499: <em><span style="color: green">+.187</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These bras are amazing.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I had actually tried going braless for a while as I read that bras are actually one of the main causes of breast cancer, as they restrict proper blood flow.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However going back to work I found that I needed something to at least cover.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So I decided to try these as the look like they didn't restrict that badly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm so glad I made the choice because I absolutely love these bras.</mark> <mark class = "neg">They give the cover I need without feeling restricting.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Also with other bras I would experience pain in my breast even when trying to go to a bigger size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These however give me no pain whatsoever.</mark> I would definitely buy these again.</p>
<h1>2500: <em><span style="color: green">+.423</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Finally found a bra that fits.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Spent a fortune with specially fitted bras only to find after a few weeks they were digging in.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So Please to have these.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are super comfortable , make you look nice and delivery was quick.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Really Really happy and would recomment these to Everyone.</mark> !</p>

<h1>2502: <em><span style="color: green">+.745</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Arrived promptly,looks and feels like a quality product,I liked the fact they are packed in a zipped bag very useful for travelling and keeping them all together in a suitcase,nice soft fabric to wear and comfortable all day.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have bought a few of these from different places but these are of a good fit and quality.</mark></p>
<h1>2503: <em><span style="color: green">+.209</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Item as described I got xxxl as you can see it's between a large and medium fit , I got smaller sizes before not true sizes really, so this time I got it right !</mark></p>

<h1>2505: <em><span style="color: green">+.392</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these bras, having previously tried other more well known brands.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material is soft and stretchy, the sizing is spot on and it feels so very comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These bras don't need any sewing adjustment on the straps as some of my others did, so that's another bonus.</mark> I'll see how they wash and wear, if no probs then I'll buy more.</p>
<h1>2506: <em><span style="color: green">+.135</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">So this product does have removable pads that come as standard for anyone curious the fit of those pads does not seem to match up very well with the fit of the bra.</mark> <mark class = "neg">In general the bra appears to be designed for shallow breasts and broad shoulders.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's redemption is that it's not too tight around the ribs but you may need to layer them which negates that to a degree</mark></p>
<h1>2507: <em><span style="color: green">+.300</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These bras so comfortable & great to wear around the house, they don't give very much support so as long as your not going anywhere important these make a great comfortable bra no digging in straps on your shoulders & wide back support, I'm so glad I brought these for home wear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Thank you</mark></p>
<h1>2508: <em><span style="color: green">+.046</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Find this bra is comfortable and firmer than the other similar products that I have used.</mark> It is on the tight side but after washing it has slightly loosened up as I expected. <mark class = "pos">Its great to wear at home and at night.</mark> I removed the padded part easily from a small slit on the side. I recommend that you buy a larger size if you dont like it tight.</p>
<h1>2509: <em><span style="color: green">+.373</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">So glad I tried these!</mark> <mark class = "neg">Been looking for a substitute for the Genie Bra which seemed to disappear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These are a great replacement - and quite a bit cheaper also, bonus.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They wash well too</mark></p>
<h1>2510: <em><span style="color: green">+.485</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Love love love this bra!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I had to change from a normal back fastening bra due to a shoulder problem and these are just great!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are comfortable, no digging in, straps stay put and generous cups and padding to give some shape.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Highly recommend!</mark></p>

<h1>2763: <em><span style="color: green">+.277</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Would recommend as good working from home underwear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Some support, but not loads - Enough for a walk, not enough to go up and down lots of stairs.</mark> They wash easily, and the pads are easily removable.</p>
<h1>2764: <em><span style="color: green">+.368</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">These are the most comfy but the most ugly at the same time - maybe I'm at that age where comfort comes before style....</mark> <mark class = "pos">but they sure are comfy......</mark> <mark class = "pos">hide the mirror and problem solved da nah!</mark></p>
<h1>2765: <em><span style="color: red">-.157</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I've have this a 1 star as the product has made me come out in a rash, red, itchy and painful.</mark> Will not buy again!</p>

<h1>2769: <em><span style="color: green">+.236</span></em></h1><p class="indented">as the advert says they are good for sleeping or wearing around home on lazy days. <mark class = "neg">they don't give much support (34 g) so i would not wear them outside as they are not very flattering.</mark> <mark class = "pos">but good for the purpose.</mark></p>
<h1>2770: <em><span style="color: red">-.267</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">It's an okay product BUT the inner padding isn't secured in place so everytime i find it that it's moved and i need to sit and fix the pads position from the little opening on the side of the bra.</mark> <mark class = "neg">After one wash the paddings totally came off and layers of it fell apart, so overall it isn't worth it, if I'd known in advance i would have sewed the padding in place before the use.</mark></p>
<h1>2771: <em><span style="color: green">+.222</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">wasn't sure what size to buy so I followed the guideline and the fit is very good XL for 38A - the pad in the cup gives you a shape
only a small problem - it is a tad awkward to put on</mark></p>
<h1>2772: <em><span style="color: red">-.211</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Bras were ok till washed. Then triangle pads inside came out. <mark class = "neg">Very annoying.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Not very well made.</mark> Slits in the sides for pads which never noticed till they were in the washing machine.</p>

<h1>2780: <em><span style="color: green">+.230</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Lovely and comfortable with a wide strap at the bottom that doesn't dig in.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Due to a problem which meant I needed a dressing worn under it was very good.</mark></p>
<h1>2781: <em><span style="color: green">+.169</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">A have to buy again for me - very soft and although I hand wash mostly have held firmness and softness.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I did that as so comfortable I wanted to take a little extra care.</mark></p>

<h1>2784: <em><span style="color: green">+.250</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I would say the size comes up one size smaller than you would expect - I have a 38" rib measurement and the XL was very tight, but you do want a firm fit on a sports bra, so this is only an opinion.</mark></p>
<h1>2785: <em><span style="color: red">-.066</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Not great.</mark> The pads keep moving around so I eventually took them out. It's not true to size either. <mark class = "pos">Ended up with one that is too big.</mark></p>

<h1>2991: <em><span style="color: green">+.524</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">For the price and the actual quality these leggings are amazing!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are a tad on the large size but I am pretty sure I will get my £13's worth by the time they get too big to wear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you're looking for good quality leggings without having to be top dollar for then these are certainly for you.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Also arrived 11 days before they where expected which was a great bonus!</mark></p>
<h1>2992: <em><span style="color: green">+.084</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I think I read about camel toe with these, then forget I'd read that and purchased anyway - since I'm sick to the back teeth of black or grey leggings.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material is brightly coloured - a welcome change.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However, it's very thin, not that glamourous if you've got lumps and bumps and the hemline around the calf is a bit wizard's sleeve on me.</mark> Might be ok on taller people. Wore them to the gym today with a rather long vest to cover my nether regions and I dare not attempt stretching or floor work after my work out due to the thinness of the material and the aforementioned camel toe. <mark class = "pos">Won't wear the to the gym again, but wouldn't be adverse to wearing them out clubbing.</mark> With a long t-shirt.....</p>

<h1>3147: <em><span style="color: green">+.304</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Love the look of this bra and how easy it is to adjust, feels secure but I wouldn't say it's high impact if you're really busty</mark></p>

<h1>3149: <em><span style="color: green">+.592</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">bought it for the gorgeous colour and the adjustable shoulder straps (I've got tiny shoulders so it is a good design for me) - it is a little small and does it's job by compression giving a 'pancake mono bust' appearance but keeps them supported when jumping about in dance class !!</mark></p>
<h1>3150: <em><span style="color: green">+.475</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good support for running.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It's a shame that this model doesn't offer more sizes (F is the biggest cup here).</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love the velcro straps and the bra is good quality and nice material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very comfortable!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Makes me enjoy running more :)</mark></p>
<h1>3151: <em><span style="color: green">+.351</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I love these for when I'm exercising.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They give me enough support for running and jumping - and I'm a 30FF!</mark> I have these in multiple colours. <mark class = "pos">Highly recommended.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They're also very comfy to wear and look flattering.</mark></p>
<h1>3152: <em><span style="color: green">+.289</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Secure.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Works by compaction.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Flattering unlike other sports bras.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Large bust friendly.</mark></p>
<h1>3153: <em><span style="color: green">+.185</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great bra, I am breastfeeding so this bra was way to undo and feed my baby.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It is also supportive enough for medium/high intensity exercise.</mark></p>
<h1>3154: <em><span style="color: green">+.575</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Yes good and supportive.</mark> As a 32F perhaps not a bra for running though.</p>
<h1>3155: <em><span style="color: green">+.315</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great for high impact exercise.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Also able to breastfeed baby in it.</mark></p>

<h1>3157: <em><span style="color: green">+.144</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good sports bra.</mark> No wobbling but quite squished. Very fiddly to put on.</p>
<h1>3158: <em><span style="color: green">+.318</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I have a 30 g and I took an S, it keep your boobs firm. <mark class = "pos">Really good!</mark> And you can also adjust to make tighter!</p>
<h1>3159: <em><span style="color: green">+.442</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good support and has adjustable straps on shoulders.</mark> <mark class = "pos">With a large bust of 32f, this bra held me in place well as well as being well priced.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Looks decent on too.</mark></p>
<h1>3160: <em><span style="color: green">+.862</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Excellent quality, super comfortable and maximum support.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's a winner in my viewüòä</mark></p>
<h1>3161: <em><span style="color: green">+.140</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Despite initially having problems fastening this bra it has proved fantastic in the gym.</mark> Keeps me 'firmly in place' during workouts. <mark class = "pos">Great buy</mark></p>
<h1>3162: <em><span style="color: green">+.199</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">At first it was so difficult to get into but once you're used to it it's actually okay!</mark> <mark class = "neg">Initially I was worried about the straps but they stayed firmly in place, though I can only speak for vinyasa and ashtanga yoga and not heavy cardio.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Felt supported and comfortable but I think the front is slightly small.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like that you can adjust the back with the clips :) overall quite surprised but happy</mark></p>
<h1>3163: <em><span style="color: green">+.206</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I bought this on the recommendation that it worked as a nursing sports bra.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So far, so good.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Although I'm not yet back to full HIIT training it seems supportive enough and I feel comfortable in it when doing little bits of jumping, cardio and conditioning circuits.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Access for nursing is good and easy to drop the front of the bra using the Velcro strap adjuster.</mark> <mark class = "neg">My only gripe is that is gets caught when threading back through afterwards and it would be easier to adjust the straps if it passed from back to front rather than front to back.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Still worth buying as it's a reasonable price for a sports bra and those suitable for nursing are hard to come by at an affordable price.</mark> I would buy again.</p>
<h1>3164: <em><span style="color: green">+.061</span></em></h1><p class="indented">My first racerback bra. <mark class = "neg">Feels great on, it's a pain to get on & off.</mark> I'd still rather wear non-racerback running bras. <mark class = "pos">The adjustable straps are great (and its the only way I can get out of it is to undo them).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Keeps the ladies in place so it does it's job well.</mark></p>
<h1>3165: <em><span style="color: green">+.115</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I am a 34F but got an E just for extra snugness which was the right choice.</mark> <mark class = "pos">After jumping around a bit at Zumba it did stretch a bit but the Velcro straps mean you can adjust this so not such a problem.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The real reason for the low score is the fact that it's HANDWASH which I did not realise.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Not ideal or hygienic for something you heavily sweat into on regular occasions!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Well it's in the washing machine now on a 30 so who knows if I will be able to wear it again....</mark></p>
<h1>3166: <em><span style="color: green">+.031</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good strong bra, good material but the fits way too small and the Velcro straps don't help when working out as you fall out!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I managed to salvage the issue by layering an older sports bra I had over the top and this seemed to do the trick.</mark> <mark class = "neg">But I wouldn't get this if you are on the larger boob scale as it's way too tight.</mark></p>
<h1>3167: <em><span style="color: green">+.517</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Arrived very quickly, I expected it to be smaller than it was, it is very comfortable, went running in it, have no complaints.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I usually use a Brooks Juno running bra which it is very like but have to say the Brooks bra is better, but it is also a lot more expensive!!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Overall a good bra at a very good price.</mark></p>
<h1>3168: <em><span style="color: green">+.641</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The fabric on the inside of the bra can feel a little rough for me as I would have sensitive skin.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However it fits well and delivery was quick.</mark></p>
<h1>3169: <em><span style="color: green">+.600</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really good support!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">It doesn't hurt my neck ,I don't feel sweaty and doesn't flattens the chest!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Also good price!!</mark></p>
<h1>3170: <em><span style="color: red">-.227</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I love this bra and it's a staple of my gym kit - however it doesn't last long.</mark> <mark class = "neg">After a month's worth of weekly wear and washing the elastic starts to weaken and it is not as supportive.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Shame.</mark></p>
<h1>3171: <em><span style="color: green">+.602</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great product, every bit as good as other more well known and expensive product out there that does the same thing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very secure</mark></p>

<h1>3187: <em><span style="color: green">+.031</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Definitely helps to keep the girls in place!!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I bought a 34E but have since discovered I'm a 32F, so I will be buying again but will stick to the 34 as a 32 would be to tight.</mark></p>
<h1>3188: <em><span style="color: green">+.215</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I've been struggling to get a decent sports bra for the larger chest. <mark class = "neg">I've been using shock absorber ultimate run, but it's been rubbing and leaving me with sores.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I've spent a small fortune trying others, and this was my last gasp attempt before giving up and going with the wounds.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's a revelation.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Ok to get into, slightly more challenging to get out of when you're sweaty (undo the chest straps, it helps!), but when it's on it's comfy and fits well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a 34FF and it fits great, the adjustable straps meant I could tighten to help hold the girls down, and best of all, no wounds!</mark> Result! <mark class = "pos">Five miles this morning in comfort.</mark> Defo buying more. Oh and it came in one day from ordering. <mark class = "pos">Overall very impressed.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Quality product.</mark></p>
<h1>3189: <em><span style="color: green">+.008</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Took a little to get use to putting on and getting off, once on quite comfortable, shoulder straps could do with a different fastening,especially for the fuller/heavier bust, hopefully Velcro won't wear out after a couple of washes.</mark></p>
<h1>3190: <em><span style="color: green">+.004</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The straps for most sports bras are too long for me and its great that i can adjust the velcro but that ends up pulling to breast so high that it looks and feels uncomfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I does hold nicely though.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I'm also breast feeling so the style is great because i can easily feed my baby with fussing with straps and having issues with the cups.</mark></p>
<h1>3191: <em><span style="color: green">+.302</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I really like the colour of this bra and have found that even though I need a large cup size it is supportive enough to train for a marathon.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I chose this model as the velcro fastening straps make it suitable for breast-feeding.</mark></p>

<h1>3246: <em><span style="color: green">+.153</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Very surprised! <mark class = "pos">For this price I had low expectations for this sports bra but is very secure and had no bounce.</mark> <mark class = "pos">For a large chest I felt very secure and they did not move even when doing jumping jacks and running.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The straps are adjustable and the padding in the chest is ideal to prevent nipples showing through.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very comfortable and will buy again.</mark> <mark class = "neg">On par with Shock Absorber bras at a fraction of the price.</mark></p>
<h1>3247: <em><span style="color: green">+.302</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I'm a G cup but they only do up to an F so I got an F and the fit was good, I wasn't using this for any real sports just for walks and light exercise.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I chose this bra because I'm nursing and it's impossible to find nursing sports bras, the Velcro straps are ideal for nursing and it's a comfy bra, it gives good shape and lift with no spillage.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Highly recommend this if you're a nursing mum looking for a bra that gives lift and support.</mark></p>
<h1>3248: <em><span style="color: green">+.219</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fantastic sports bra.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very high impact - have previously bought shock absorbers and I would say this is almost as good as the ultimate run bra - but better for me as it's padded.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a size 36F and feeding my daughter and it's the only thing I've found to work.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Can run & do HIIT in it and due to Velcro adjustable straps at front can be used as a nursing bra.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Would say it's not as easy to use as regular nursing bras or exercise nursing bras (I found them useless for exercise support) but it's not designed with that in mind.</mark> <mark class = "pos">That being said it works very effectively as a nursing bra AND is an excellent high impact bra for a larger bust.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Hard to get on and off initially due to crop design (fitted round the chest not like a bra) but that adds to its high impact support.</mark></p>
<h1>3249: <em><span style="color: green">+.092</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I ordered a 36f even though my bra size is 34e as these sports tops usually are on the small side.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Unfortunately I couldn't even fasten it on the loosest setting.</mark> It measures 29 inches around the band so not really surprising that I couldn't fasten it! <mark class = "neg">Disappointing as desperately need a sports top that fits.</mark></p>

<h1>3251: <em><span style="color: red">-.014</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I was really hoping this Sports Bra would fit, but it didn't.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I ordered a 36F which is my regular size, but have recently lost weight so was confident it would fit.</mark> It doesn't open front or back so had to be stepped into and pulled up which took a lot of manoeuvring. <mark class = "neg">There is a final clasp to close at the back, but it was 4 inches short of each side meeting.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Meaning this sports bra would fit a 32F not a 36.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Very disappointed and am returning.</mark></p>
<h1>3252: <em><span style="color: green">+.309</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Clearly well made, the bra definitely needs underwires as it fitted comfortably but gave an unflattering 'monoboob' effect.</mark> Going back if I can find return address.</p>
<h1>3253: <em><span style="color: green">+.109</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I found the sizing a bit small and it is hard to get on and off but it absorbs sweat very well and is very supportive!</mark> <mark class = "neg">Brought a size 36FF but I maybe should have gone bigger</mark></p>

<h1>3255: <em><span style="color: red">-.275</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The velcro fastenings on the straps are an interesting idea, but it does make them stiff and bulky.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Just cut them off and stitch the straps in place, they're much comfier that way!</mark></p>
<h1>3256: <em><span style="color: green">+.131</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Wanted a high impact sports bra - a little disappointed with Velcro straps but they seem to hold up well so far</mark></p>

cons:

-too big in the cups by at least one size
-cut too narrow in front of the armpits

Overall, this bra is fine for low impact workouts at home, but not something I'd wear to exercise in public.</mark></p>

<h1>3436: <em><span style="color: green">+.049</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I genuinely love these bras.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are the most comfortable I have found for my relatively active job although I wouldn't recommend actually running in them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The support isn't quite good enough for more than a quick jog down some stairs.</mark> <mark class = "neg">This purchase however has disappointed me a little due to the colour of the bra ordered.</mark> The image provided by the seller shows the beige as being very light.

<h1>3437: <em><span style="color: red">-.096</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Comfortable when not used for exercise and instead used day to day, i did buy it for med-high impact exercise as i'm a fitness instructor but not even supportive for medium impact.</mark> size 34E</p>

<h1>3439: <em><span style="color: green">+.216</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I ordered this sports bra in my size- sometimes not easy to get 34E as a normal bra either so I was surprised that a sports bra comes in normal sizes and not just the usual small/medium/big nonsense.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's amazingly comfortable,size fits perfectly and I just didn't expect that for that price!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I absolutely love it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm using it for yoga so can't say if it's good enough for running for example (maybe it is) but for yoga or gym, I'd definitely recommend.</mark></p>
<h1>3440: <em><span style="color: green">+.425</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Soft yet good quality, sturdy breathable material, super supportive, thick back band and straps so there's no cutting into skin, 3 notch fastening for security and a pretty colour!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I LOVE THIS, will order multiples when I've lost weight and this one no longer fits because it's fabulous.</mark></p>

<h1>3443: <em><span style="color: green">+.497</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The hook and eye fastening are sticking into my back a little uncomfortable, the seams in the cup are very visible through your clothes, but it is very comfy and I use it everyday.</mark></p>

<h1>3463: <em><span style="color: green">+.036</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really, really comfortable but as a 34F, there's no way I'd wear this for high impact sport as recommended.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's materials are too stretchy to be able to provide the firm support you need in high impact activities.</mark> I'll use this only for a bike ride on the road, motor biking or a walk. <mark class = "neg">I bought this as I thought it would be a good alternative to my usual Shock Absorbers and whilst it is more comfortable to wear, it's not a patch on the quality and support offered by a Shock Absorber.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I'm not even sure if it's bonafide as the information card that comes with it is riddled with spelling mistakes.</mark></p>

<h1>3555: <em><span style="color: green">+.367</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good as is and for light workout, but if you're like me and have trouble keeping your straps up then this is not for you :( straps started slipping halfway into a run.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Other than that it fits nicely and is very comfortable.</mark></p>
<h1>3556: <em><span style="color: red">-.007</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I dont understand where they get high impact from as this bra clearly isnt that there is no bounce control or surport as clearly stated on sale ive tried this tonight and its not even gettin a wash its £14.00 straight in the bin clearly waste of money</mark></p>

<h1>3568: <em><span style="color: green">+.317</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I bought a 38DD, expecting it to be almost too tight on the widest hooks, and it's a little loose even done up on the smallest hooks.</mark> OK for short runs but definitely go down a size or two if you want to eliminate all bounce. <mark class = "pos">It washes well and dries quickly, and it looks a lot nicer than the usual industrial strength bras available for larger ladies.</mark></p>
<h1>3569: <em><span style="color: green">+.645</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really comfortable fit, lovely soft material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I bought my regular size and it's perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Good support for low impact movements but I found only medium support for myself (if you are bigger busted) for any kind exercises that involve jumping/jogging on the spot etc.</mark></p>

<h1>3582: <em><span style="color: green">+.111</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I had to return this bra as it was a size smaller in the cup than my usual brand, Debenhams Gorgeous, I got this in 38E. I tried jumping up and down while trying it on and it definitely does minimize bounce, but not as much as I would like it too.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It also squishes my breasts to the side, giving me extra lumps to the side of the cup, which I don't have when braless or wearing other brands, maybe that's just down to the too small cups size, but I'd rather try another product that is underwired rather than a different size of this one.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material and colours look good though.</mark></p>
<h1>3583: <em><span style="color: green">+.222</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I needed another sports bra because the expensive one I have which was a lovely white, has turned grey with washing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The straps on this one has started off looking like it was white once and turned grey through wash.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Looked at the other colours and they are all the same - no black straps.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But apart from that its OK, gives good support</mark></p>
<h1>3584: <em><span style="color: green">+.331</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fit is brilliant!</mark> <mark class = "pos">As I am sized as 38F (UK) , I wasn't expecting much support or much bounce control, I am thrilled with both!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Could easily wear this as an everyday bra, as the support is great!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Bounce control six in my opinion very good, still bounce, but I don't feel uncomfortable when they land after doing star jumps and in the spot jogging!</mark> <mark class = "pos">The colour purple is bright and the same as it is in the picture!</mark></p>
<h1>3585: <em><span style="color: green">+.432</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Ive tried loads of different ones and this has soft comfy straps is light weight and very comfortable to wear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I read the reviews and ordered a back size bigger and a cup size smaller which made it a really good fit with lots of support for exercise but for running or high impact type jumping, being a 36g i still need to double up (which is why i only gave 4 stars) i put a zip front one that crosses over at the back to give extra support and was able to run comfortably.</mark></p>

<h1>3807: <em><span style="color: red">-.010</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I have bought quite a few of these over the last two years and they are still going strong.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am a big gal, and wear these as my choice for a bra most days.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I also ride downhill on an mtb (Whyte T-130 C-RS), so they get a real workout most weekends.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The only downside with them are the labels - the scratch the hell out of my back and make it itch.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Once you are sure they are for you, carefully remove the labels as close to the root as possible, and fray the cut edges with a nail file.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Best bras I have ever owned, and that's the truth!</mark> :)</p>
<h1>3808: <em><span style="color: green">+.409</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I needed a good bra for work where I happen to bend down a lot.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This nicely keeps everything in the right place, so comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Would definitely recommend, I might actually be buying another one for myself very soon.</mark></p>
<h1>3809: <em><span style="color: green">+.070</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">If you're buying this for sports wear then don't expect to be kept 'still' while you jump around.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's the most comfortable soft bra I've ever worn but it's no good at all for sports.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Maybe I needed to buy a size smaller than my usual fit in order to get enough support for sportswear........?</mark></p>
<h1>3810: <em><span style="color: green">+.878</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">good quality and Fit as expected</mark></p>
<h1>3811: <em><span style="color: green">+.774</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really comfortable and stylish.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I will use this for medium to low impact exercise as it doesn't strap me down like other high end sports bras.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Really good value for money & beautifully made though so will definitely buy again.</mark></p>
<h1>3812: <em><span style="color: green">+1.096</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good support and prompt delivery</mark></p>
<h1>3813: <em><span style="color: red">-.201</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Love the bra but the first wash the dark blue colour ran so I now have a pale blue bra!!!</mark> <mark class = "neg">Why don't you make it all white or skintone??</mark></p>
<h1>3814: <em><span style="color: green">+.583</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fantastic fit ,so comfortable ,best sports bra ever</mark></p>
<h1>3815: <em><span style="color: green">+1.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Brilliant</mark></p>
<h1>3816: <em><span style="color: green">+.427</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The product, if fits, will be a very good one.</mark></p>
<h1>3817: <em><span style="color: green">+.415</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I love the bra but it comes out too big</mark></p>
<h1>3818: <em><span style="color: green">+.955</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Very happy</mark></p>
<h1>3819: <em><span style="color: green">+.302</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I found this La Isla High Impact Supportive Control bra to be very comfortable to wear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It provides quite good support.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It fits more as a minimiser bra rather than giving a defined bust line, but that is not necessarily a bad thing for a well endowed woman.</mark> <mark class = "pos">After reading other reviews I went up a cup size and found this was the right thing to do.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have both the blue/white and the grey/black versions.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The only down-side I have found is that the material does not have a smooth polyester nylon finish and it therefore tends to 'bobble' where it comes into contact with your t-shirt.</mark></p>
<h1>3820: <em><span style="color: green">+.295</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Finally a sports bra that fits and supports!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I decided to buy mine one band size larger than I normally am (because of past experience with not true to size bras), which ended up being the perfect decision.</mark> So I'm guessing these bras could possibly be a bit on the tight side if you buy true to size but, I wouldn't know for sure. <mark class = "pos">That aside, this bra fits comfortably and has given me great support whilst exercising so far.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Would definitely recommend :)</mark></p>
<h1>3821: <em><span style="color: green">+.298</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This fits well is very very comfortable to wear.</mark> I shall be buying another. <mark class = "pos">I only rated this as 4 stars as it is marketed as high impact but is more medium than high.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My other high impact bras and sports bras allow much less movement than this.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I imagine a smaller cup size may be more fitting of the high impact description but I am on the larger side of the spectrum.</mark> <mark class = "pos">A good bra, nice fabric suitable for lighter excercise, washes well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I do find ordering bras tricky, so the one I order in another colour will be a larger cup size and a smaller back measurement, for me this may give a more "high impact" fit.</mark></p>
<h1>3822: <em><span style="color: green">+.166</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I have always had problems buying bras and sports bras.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I've gone to bravissimo which is incredibly pricey and so I was sceptical about purchasing one online but it is phenomenal.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It fits like a dream and although it says it's for high impact, that's only true if you're at the gym.</mark> For smaller breasted women I'm sure it holds much tighter than I. <mark class = "pos">My bra size wasn't actually on here I'm a 44H but I got the 44FF and I'm honestly very satisfied with this purchase.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Wishful thinking, but as my breasts very smaller I shall definitely come back and purchase more.</mark></p>
<h1>3823: <em><span style="color: green">+.541</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Nice long vest tops in a lovely soft jersey fabric.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I've worn and washed these lots now with no signs of damage and they still feel soft.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have a very long body and standard length tops are just too short but these are perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Wish they came in more colours!</mark></p>
<h1>3824: <em><span style="color: green">+.420</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Perfect fit and material!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love working out in these.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are so comfortable and will defo buy more in the future.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The price is just fair for the quality you get.</mark></p>
<h1>3825: <em><span style="color: red">-.043</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Definitely larger than expected not sure worth the value but there ok</mark></p>

<h1>3834: <em><span style="color: red">-.064</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Ordered this due to my sister having and loving it.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Unfortunately for me it was not so great.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Although I ordered the exact same colour and style as my sister the fabric couldn't be more different, this one makes my skin itch and my sisters is sort cotton, why does the exact same product have different fabric?</mark> <mark class = "pos">Seems like a lucky dip of a good product or a bad one, lots of loose threads too.</mark></p>
<h1>3835: <em><span style="color: red">-.069</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Short but wide, color not as expected (ordered wine got strong red color).</mark> Cuts are so big they show a lot especially in chest area</p>
