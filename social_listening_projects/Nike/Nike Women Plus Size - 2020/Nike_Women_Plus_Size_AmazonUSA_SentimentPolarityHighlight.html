<h1>1: <em><span style="color: green">+.200</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I caught these on sale for $12 and am so glad I gave this pair/brand a try.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Wore them for my HIIT class today and they helped me keep confident during my workout.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I hate a rolling waistband and these stayed in place the whole time.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric rivals that of Lululemon and were long enough (I am 5'11 and they hit at the top of my shin area).</mark> <mark class = "pos">I highly recommend</mark></p>
<h1>2: <em><span style="color: green">+.354</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These leggings are now my favorite workout pants.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They're buttery soft, but stay in place, and move with me during my workout.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They're comfortable at the waist, but stay put.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They're a bit see through when stretched to the max and a bit thinner feeling than the more rigid leggings I've had from the Amazon Basics brand, but it's still much better then non-athletic leggings and much more comfortable than those rigid ones.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'd highly recommend them!</mark></p>
<h1>3: <em><span style="color: green">+.342</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">i am 65,5'4",170lbs and go to planet fitness 3 days a week.</mark> <mark class = "pos">they go on easy(I have a natural large behind)they stay in place, soft material and def not see thru.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like that they are high waist and there is a pocket in the back to put my iPod.</mark> <mark class = "pos">totally recommend!</mark></p>
<h1>4: <em><span style="color: green">+.664</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are my new favorite leggings!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Super soft, super flattering and so comfy.</mark> I just ordered a second pair and I'm sure I'll be ordering more in the future.</p>

<h1>6: <em><span style="color: green">+.262</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I am 5' 2", 215 lbs and curvy. Based on customer reviews, I ordered an XL at first but they felt too tight. I returned them and ordered the 1X. <mark class = "pos">They are still snug, but in a comfortable way.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have learned that these are very 'straight up and down' and that if you are curvy, you may want to order up a size (even if it means you are putting a few extra 'X's on to the size that you usually don't)!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I do recommend them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material is strong, and so super soft.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are very well made.</mark></p>
<h1>7: <em><span style="color: green">+.189</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I ordered one size above my normal, and these are absolutely tiny. <mark class = "pos">I'll give them to my young daughter.</mark></p>
<h1>8: <em><span style="color: green">+.255</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">High waisted, has a pocket in the waste band.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like the length and the color.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Dries fast.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Perfect for the gym</mark></p>
<h1>9: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Not a fan. Too thin. Ran large</p>
<h1>10: <em><span style="color: green">+.062</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I am used to cheap yoga pants being see-through, but not these!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are really great, fit as expected and most importantly, dont roll down.</mark> I would buy them again.</p>
<h1>11: <em><span style="color: green">+.770</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Comfy and cute.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Love them.</mark></p>
<h1>12: <em><span style="color: red">-.118</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">It certainly holds you in place but getting them on and off is challenging to say the least.</mark> Would not buy again</p>
<h1>13: <em><span style="color: green">+.636</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Nice fit</mark></p>
<h1>14: <em><span style="color: green">+.174</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I like the fit.</mark> <mark class = "neg">They don't roll when working out.</mark></p>
<h1>15: <em><span style="color: green">+.084</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These pants are extremely soft and stretchy.</mark> I wear a size 14 and 170lbs and the 1x is tight on my stomach. So it does run a bit small. <mark class = "pos">However, the pants are comfortable for hanging around the house, yoga or exercising.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The fall just below the knees and there is a pocket in the back for keys and such.</mark></p>
<h1>16: <em><span style="color: green">+.239</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">My daughter loves the Core 10 Yoga Pants!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit as expected, but by looking at them, you wouldn't think so!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They definitely stretch and as my daughter said, she felt "put together".</mark> They are high waisted and she didn't fold them over. They aren't really made to fold over, so just know they are high waisted. <mark class = "pos">The Core 10 Yoga Pants are comfortable and wash well.</mark> As you can see by the picture below, they come to her ankle, but she is only 5'2" tall. <mark class = "pos">Overall, a nice fit and good look for her.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I would like to see the price
point in the $25-$30 range and not $35.</mark></p>
<h1>17: <em><span style="color: green">+.193</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I'm so bummed that these didn't fit me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love the design of these leggings so much!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I gave them to my daughter and they looks so flattering on her!</mark> The length of the leggings goes to a couple inches below the knee. <mark class = "pos">The thin black and white stripes look really cute and my daughter reported that they stretch well with your body during work outs.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Overall, these leggings run small so buy them 2 sizes larger and they will look fantastic on you!</mark> :)</p>
<h1>18: <em><span style="color: green">+.329</span></em></h1><p class="indented">These leggings are thick and quite opaque. <mark class = "pos">The bottom cuff is a little tight on my calf (I have sturdy calves) but other than that the fit is awesome.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They wash up well, the stitching is sturdy and the fabric is comfortable and breathable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Love them!</mark></p>
<h1>19: <em><span style="color: green">+.432</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I love wearing leggings around the house.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These High Waist Capri leggings are very comfy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is nice and thick, and the high waist makes them extra comfy.</mark> Four stars because I need to see how they hold up after multiple washings.</p>
<h1>20: <em><span style="color: green">+.354</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Quality fabric and workmanship.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great feel and soft stretchy comfortable cotton.</mark> Wash/dry without fading. <mark class = "pos">High waist is perfect so you don't have to keep pulling them up throughout the day or your workout.</mark></p>

<h1>22: <em><span style="color: green">+.531</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I wish these weren't so expensive because I want them in every color and style!</mark> I will DEFINITELY be getting more. <mark class = "pos">They fit so true to size, they're super high quality (hence the higher price tag - totally justified), and I instantly felt lifted, supported and ready to workout with confidence!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I heard about these through following Jessamyn Stanley on instagram and I'm SO glad I did!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Seriously my new go-to workout brand from now on.</mark></p>
<h1>23: <em><span style="color: green">+.308</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are great pants.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are clearly tights, but they don't cling.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm short and the crops are almost ankle-length for me (perfect, imo).</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are soft and comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In fact, I liked them so much, I purchased a second pair.</mark></p>
<h1>24: <em><span style="color: green">+.343</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I am 5'9 and a true size 2X in athletic/yoga bottoms.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These capris fit PERFECT.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are buttery soft have just the right amount of control to lift your butt and tuck your tummy as its not so tight where your getting a belly ache.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Perfect length on my calf and nice and snug, nothing worse than a plus size capri that is baggy in the leg & calf.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Wish more colors were in-stock in the 2X that's the only bummer.</mark></p>
<h1>25: <em><span style="color: green">+.237</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I'm so glad I bought these.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a size 18-20, and these fit really well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">And they are comfortable!!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">The pocket is a bit useless because it's so shallow - but the pants are so comfy that I don't really care.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If it had useable pockets it would be 6 stars!</mark> <mark class = "pos">The teal color is bright and has not faded in the wash.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wash it in cold water, usually on the gentle setting, and hang it up to dry.</mark></p>
<h1>26: <em><span style="color: green">+.338</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are very high quality and the top doesn't roll down at all and I am a larger woman.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material is super soft and these wash and dry well.</mark> I will buy more of these.</p>
<h1>27: <em><span style="color: green">+.064</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I own four pairs of these now. <mark class = "pos">They are comfortable and comparable to my Lulu ones.</mark> <mark class = "neg">As with the higher price brand, I recommend no fabric softener and hang dry when possible.</mark> This will extend the life of your leggings and avoid stretching of the fabric. <mark class = "pos">These are squat proof and the higher rise helps with insecurities in my waist.</mark></p>
<h1>28: <em><span style="color: green">+.263</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are the most comfortable leggings around.</mark> I plan on ordering more. <mark class = "pos">The legs stay in place when I move, and they give a great shape under tops because they hold things in place.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My friend bought a pair because she loved mine so much!</mark></p>
<h1>29: <em><span style="color: green">+.314</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Have ordered twice for myself and once for my daughter.</mark> <mark class = "pos">LOVE them!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">You won't be disappointed.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is soft, opaque, but not too thick or hot.</mark> Holds their shape after washing.</p>
<h1>30: <em><span style="color: green">+.376</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Super smooth and buttery soft!</mark> Didn't seem see through. <mark class = "neg">I loved the print but sent them back because I'm not confident enough yet to wear print.</mark></p>

<h1>32: <em><span style="color: green">+.641</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Nice high wasted well made yoga pants that fit like a dream.</mark> <mark class = "pos">No falling down which is a major miracle.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Love them.</mark></p>

<h1>48: <em><span style="color: green">+.312</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I love the feel of these pants.</mark> I have tons of yoga pants. <mark class = "pos">These have a soft, but strong stretchy feeling to them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are great to wear because they are so comfortable and soft.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They also have compression to keep me from jiggling while working out.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like the high waist as well for keeping me comfortable while working out.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The pants stay in place to create optimum comfort while moving.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love how these pants look and feel on me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like being able to work out without having to adjust my clothes to keep covered or put them back into place.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The black and gray fabric is a little interest to my otherwise black workout clothes.</mark></p>
<h1>49: <em><span style="color: green">+.255</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Wife wanted to try these so I thought I would give her the chance.</mark> <mark class = "pos">What can I say, they fit exactly like they are supposed to fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My wife is taller at 5 foot 10 inches tall and these still looked good on her.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit as expected.</mark> <mark class = "pos">She said the feel nice and stretch just the right amount.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are great for exercising in as well as wearing around the house.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My wife likes them and does recommend them.</mark> <mark class = "neg">There really was no issue with the fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Her size was pretty spot on so I am thinking these guys have the sizing down.</mark></p>

<h1>51: <em><span style="color: green">+.307</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This is not a Womans' 2X it is a Miss size 17/18 which means it is too small for me but fits my third daughter perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">She is delighted with this it is soft and stretchy, very comfortable , with an athletic body hugging fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It looks and feels good on her and feels supportive while giving her free unrestricted movement.</mark> She wants more. of these.</p>
<h1>52: <em><span style="color: green">+.217</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I like the capri length on these leggings.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit great.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I've become a fan of the core 10 for their quality and reasonable price.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The higher waist band stays with me as I bend, twist, fall on the floor panting...</mark> er yeah. <mark class = "pos">They wash well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I air dry all my workout pants to keep their shape and keep the material fresh and flexible.</mark></p>
<h1>53: <em><span style="color: green">+.329</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This provide a thicker fabric than many leggings but are still flexible.</mark> <mark class = "pos">No worries about seeing through them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Moderate compression.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Wide variety of sizes fit as expected for the size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Well made and a bargain compared to many.</mark></p>
<h1>54: <em><span style="color: green">+.479</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fall down a bit, but otherwise perfect for yoga</mark></p>
<h1>55: <em><span style="color: green">+.529</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great material and the fit was great.</mark></p>
<h1>56: <em><span style="color: red">-.065</span></em></h1><p class="indented">These are small for the size indicated. <mark class = "neg">The material is flimsy, not very stretchy.</mark> I cannot do yoga in these, they don't have the give needed to do the exercises. <mark class = "neg">Also, they are not smart enough looking to just wear for everyday.</mark></p>
<h1>57: <em><span style="color: green">+.098</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Wow.</mark> <mark class = "neg">They are soft and smoothing and suck you in with out being tight.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material is nice and different then other work out clothes.</mark> It's not shiney. I can move in them. And biggest selling point is they dont roll down! They are also not see through.</p>
<h1>58: <em><span style="color: green">+.116</span></em></h1><p class="indented">If you don't already know, the Core10 is Amazon's own clothing brand. According to their size chart, Amazon's standard size chart, a size 3xl fits 53 - 55inch hips. <mark class = "neg">I am not between these sizes (a little below) but I always order a size or two up, since shopping while having wide hips/thick thighs can be challenging.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These pants DO fit, however, they are very snug.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If you have a butt, these will not fully cover that up as you move/bent around.</mark> The material is okay, not as luxe as some of the Nike brands (of course), but doesn't have that workout feel material. <mark class = "pos">It feels more like leggings you were with a cute outfit than something you would want to wear to the gym or to workout.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It reminds me of the "new quality" Old navy has now vs a couple of years ago.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The color is a little lighter than photographed (I thought it was more peachy-orange) since it also has that peppered/heathered style fabric.</mark> If you order from the Core10 brand, as I've tried other pants from them in plus sizes, I would size up one and maybe even two (if you get leggings or any compression pants). <mark class = "pos">I probably will not reorder until Amazon gets in new styles/fits.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I also DID return these LOL. I hope this helps :)</mark></p>
<h1>59: <em><span style="color: green">+.251</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I underestimated Amazon and I wasn't expecting much from this brand.</mark> I sized up thinking they'd be too tight or too see through. <mark class = "neg">I was so wrong!</mark> <mark class = "pos">These are super super soft and well made.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I decided to keep the 3x for some lounging around pants, but I fully intend to order a 2x in the future and I'm positive they will fit perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My only complaint would be that the black isn't quite as black as I would like.</mark></p>
<h1>60: <em><span style="color: green">+.191</span></em></h1><p class="indented">This is my second pair of these (marine blue). <mark class = "pos">I have been wearing the heathered gray about three times a week for the last 6 months (don't judge lol) because they're my favorite.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am going to buy them in every color because they're just so comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I was a little hesitant about the price because $40 for leggings is a tad ridiculous but it's worth it because they're my favorite pants.</mark></p>
<h1>61: <em><span style="color: green">+.066</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are the best Capri cropped yoga workout bottoms I've ever owned!!</mark> <mark class = "neg">They aren't shiny but have s perfect soft matte black color that does everything I need them too including perfect coverage for tummy, rear, thighs and more!</mark> <mark class = "pos">It holds you in while not feeling tight or restricting!</mark> I don't know how they do it. <mark class = "pos">It's like magic fabric.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'll be purchasing every color in this and highly recommend for plus size ladies!</mark></p>
<h1>62: <em><span style="color: green">+.580</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These leggings are worth every penny!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I tried the amazon prime wardrobe to make sure I liked them because they are pricy but these are hands down the best leggings I've ever had and I love that they come in PLUS SIZE!!</mark></p>
<h1>63: <em><span style="color: green">+.176</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">They are soft, but I have big legs, so they were super snug on my legs but too big around my waist.</mark> The tightness in the legs kept pulling them down. The waist rolled down every time I moved and the bottom was way too tight on my calf.</p>
<h1>64: <em><span style="color: green">+.666</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I loved the color of these!</mark> <mark class = "pos">It was always hard to find plus size yoga pants on Amazon but these fit very well and are comfortable as well as true to size.</mark></p>
<h1>65: <em><span style="color: red">-.103</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The amethyst color is darker than I expected, and yet you can still see my underwear underneath.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Kind of a bummer but still works for my intended use.</mark></p>
<h1>66: <em><span style="color: green">+.036</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">They're a little on the shorter side than other capris and they tend to fall down from my waist.</mark> I'd probably buy a size smaller than what I usually wear so they stay up. <mark class = "pos">Still, they're comfortable and I'll wear them for exercise.</mark></p>
<h1>67: <em><span style="color: green">+.139</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I don;t even know I am wearing them, they are that comfortable.</mark></p>

The only thing I disliked about them was the weird seam running up the back of the legs.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I don't understand why its there plus its kind of uncomfortable.</mark> I actually turned them around so the back is at the front---looks a bit like a stitched in crease.

<h1>178: <em><span style="color: green">+.158</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These leggings are so cute and I LOVE the placement of the pocket in the back!</mark> I'm 100% buying another pair! <mark class = "pos">For the record I'm 6'4 and 275 pounds so finding leggings that fit me well and make me feel sexy is not common!!!</mark></p>
<h1>179: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">A little tighter than expected for the size... also not very breathable. But not see-through.</p>

<h1>184: <em><span style="color: green">+.248</span></em></h1><p class="indented">These are the only pants I ever want to wear now. <mark class = "pos">They're incredibly comfortable and flattering.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is soft yet durable and very breathable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They don't get the funky sweaty smell all my other workout pants get after a long day of sweating in them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The capri length ones hit me (5'4") mid-calf, just where I like them, and the v waist is so comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The only flaw I see with these pants is that when I put my phone in the back pocket, the rubber of my case sticks out and rubs against my lower back, causing really uncomfortable friction.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This might not be an issue if you have a smaller phone (I have the iPhone 7) or don't use a case.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It could be fixed by simply making the pocket a little deeper or by moving the pocket to the thigh, which would be ideal in my opinion for accessibility.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But I won't let that small flaw effect my rating because just that they have a pocket at all is amazing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Overall, these are really great quality pants and I highly recommend them, especially if you're plus sized like me and have trouble finding quality workout gear.</mark></p>
<h1>185: <em><span style="color: green">+.025</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I love these pants!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They look good, and they are comfortable.</mark> I ordered the high waisted version, when they arrived and I tried them on I discovered they actually were high waisted! <mark class = "neg">They are even tall enough over the rear!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I wish that I had bought more than one pair.</mark></p>
<h1>186: <em><span style="color: green">+.280</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Fits small, pocket not functional to hold me phone which is a dealbreaker. <mark class = "pos">Thick, quality feeling material though.</mark></p>
<h1>187: <em><span style="color: green">+.126</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are a high quality product, but tend to jut out on the hips, so they look a little weird on me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like that they have a comfy fit - but I need to wear long shirts the cover the hip portions that leave me self-conscious.</mark></p>
<h1>188: <em><span style="color: green">+.399</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I read a positive review of these pants and thought at this price I can afford to give it a try.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I was quite surprised at the fit and quality.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It was fun choosing the exact elements that I wanted in length and waistband style, They are great and I recommend them to my friends who like me spend a lot of time in the gym and on the running trail.</mark></p>
<h1>189: <em><span style="color: green">+.003</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These were comfortable but nothing to write home about.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They felt like every other pair of leggings I've owned.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My only reason for not giving them 5 stars is they gave me a camel toe (and I did order my correct size).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Ordered them to try as part of a Prime Wardrobe order and ended up returning them.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Like I said, they were fine, but not worth over $50 in my opinion.</mark></p>

<h1>191: <em><span style="color: green">+.202</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are comfortable, not see-through, stay in place, and look great.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I don't have to think about them when I'm wearing them, and that's the gold standard in my book!</mark></p>

<h1>193: <em><span style="color: green">+.125</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I love these leggings and would give them 5 stars except for one little thing.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I wish the 7/8 crop and Capri leggings were available in "short" lengths (or "tall" for all you tall ladies!) I'm 5'3" and the 7/8 crop come to my ankle where full length leggings should hit and the Capri hit where a 7/8 length should.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I would love Capri leggings that were actually Capri length.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Otherwise they are super comfy and not see through at all!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Love them</mark></p>
<h1>194: <em><span style="color: green">+.223</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This yoga capri is top quality in design, build, and fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is thick and stretches around your curves for a custom fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I ordered the cross waist and it too contures to a perfect fit with no binding whatsoever.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm 5'2" and usually require a short or petite size for length and overall fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's like this capri was designed to fit all sizes and lengths.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I have worn Hard Tails for a long time, but they have discontinued my favorite style, which is why I decided to try this capri.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In my opinion, it exceeds the quality of Hard Tail, at a far better cost.</mark></p>

<h1>231: <em><span style="color: green">+.212</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This is a good pair of leggings.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I've worn them to the gym a few times and am happy with the fit and performance.</mark> I'm rather tall (almost 5'10") and these end just about 3 inches below my knee. <mark class = "pos">The waist isn't too high or low, and they stay in place whether I am on the treadmill or lifting weights.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The all black, simple style goes with every single workout shirt I own and will never clash with my sneakers.</mark> <mark class = "pos">As a friend of mine once said as we were training for our first 5K, running clothes should be "party on the top, business on the bottom," meaning crazy shirt and solid leggings.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's a philosophy I agree with, and these capris are definitely business on the bottom.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are very comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">One practical addition is a small zippered key pocket on the back of the pants.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They have so far washed well without any shrinking or fading.</mark></p>
<h1>232: <em><span style="color: green">+.095</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Let me preface this... <mark class = "neg">I'm 5'4" and I've always been a skinny girl, and now I'm 30, and suddenly im 140lbs not 90lbs.</mark> I've got thick thighs, now get "chub rub" and my yoga pants get peely in that area. <mark class = "pos">That being said, I love the material of these yoga pants.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love the cross cross waist, and how they are tight and forgiving in the right places.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I ordered a Large and it fits perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm deducting half a star because the color isn't a true black.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I'd call it a dark charcoal grey.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Normally, not important, but I had planned on wearing these under dresses/tunics to work.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My dress code is all black and these stand out, much lighter than my black work dresses.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I will still keep these because they're awesome.</mark></p>
<h1>233: <em><span style="color: green">+.196</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I really wanted to like the cross waist because it has a slimming effect, and if it had been just a little bit higher it would have worked.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But as soon as I moved around, the center of the cross stitch moved below my belly button, and I need something to cover my belly button.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But I liked the material, so I may order in the high waist.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I just wish they had some with patterns</mark></p>
<h1>234: <em><span style="color: green">+.172</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">It's a good being at the house type of legging, it's unflattering on the booty and definitely not squat proof.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Love the waist area, I'm pear shape so maybe that has the unflattering booty situation.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Oh also it was so tight on the calves, I'm not even that thicc calved lol, it was an easy fix just stretched it out a bit.</mark></p>
<h1>235: <em><span style="color: green">+.223</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">For the price and quality, it's a win.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I've only word a couple of times but I'm very picky with leggings because I am not tolerant of anything relatively close to see through or those horrible than materials that let the world know you would definitely have cellulite.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So these pants are a keeper because they have very good material that provides coverage and comfort and a good fit in terms of stretch and shape</mark></p>
<h1>236: <em><span style="color: green">+.122</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">They stretch and are soft and comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However, based on my understanding of my own size, these were smaller than I expected of a "Large".</mark> <mark class = "neg">"Large seems to mean a size 10, at least that would be my guess.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However, they do guarantee 100% satisfaction inc. returns, so that at least eliminates the risk of a poor fit.</mark> Perhaps your experience will be different, but for me "Large" was quite small--not for legs, but the rest. <mark class = "pos">I did like the capri length and feel although the sizing was too small for me.</mark> .</p>
<h1>237: <em><span style="color: green">+.212</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are slightly small to size and therefore a little tighter than I really prefer.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Capris are always a nice compromise when doing slow warm exercies like yoga, pilates or tai-chi.</mark> These have a tiny pocket in the high in the back of the band that can hold maybe headphone cords or a key. <mark class = "pos">Overall, really nice.</mark></p>
<h1>238: <em><span style="color: red">-.030</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The crossover waist is great!</mark> <mark class = "pos">It doesn't cut into my stomach.</mark> But the legs are very tight from the knees down. <mark class = "neg">Uncomfortably tight.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Also, the material is heavy and a bit stiff.</mark> Sending them back.</p>
<h1>239: <em><span style="color: green">+.159</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The fabric is soft.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The pants are quite fitted on me and maybe run a slight bit on the small side.</mark> The seams are a bit thick and while they don't rub, you can feel them. <mark class = "pos">Overall they are decent.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The waist pockets is decent size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I can (barely) fit a whole iPhone in it.</mark></p>
<h1>240: <em><span style="color: green">+.173</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These capri pants are very thick material and provide a lot of tummy support.</mark> I also like that hair and fuzz doesn't stick to them like my other workout pants. They have been washed several times and have not pilled up or faded.</p>
<h1>241: <em><span style="color: red">-.177</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Promised not to roll down.</mark> Rolled on me. <mark class = "neg">Annoyed I spent this $$ on them.</mark></p>

<h1>245: <em><span style="color: green">+.193</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">This is amazing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are a thicker fabric, high wasted and all around great yoga pants</mark></p>
<h1>246: <em><span style="color: green">+.024</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These seem to be made of okay quality fabric, but the waistband will not stay up!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wear a L to XL in all other yoga pants (depending on their particular fit), so I ordered an XL in this brand to try and be sure they would not be too small.</mark> They are VERY tight.

I am 5'10", rise comes to just under my belly button. <mark class = "pos">Shorts stay in place rather well and are adjusting to my size changing as I lose weight.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They look nice and the pocket fits my phone.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The waist holds my loose skin in place while exercising and is comfortable on my c-section scar.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I will definitely get a couple more pairs to wear after my next birth to support the incision as it heals.</mark> <mark class = "neg">My only complaint is the complete lack of breathability.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are very warm, I cannot wear them at all if the temp is over 90F. I would prefer a breathable panel on these shorts so I could wear them in the middle of summer.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Unfortunately, I'm going to have to replace these with a shorter or more breathable pair for July/Aug.</mark></p>
<h1>340: <em><span style="color: red">-.158</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I am very bottom heavy at 5'2 and 195 lbs. <mark class = "neg">The XL were a great fit and I wanted to keep them badly due to fit alone, but couldn't get past the seamwork.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The seamwork along inner thighs felt very rough and even standing without legs touching felt annoying/always there.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Add a little exercise and sweat in and I am sure my sensitive skin would be rubbed raw.</mark></p>
<h1>341: <em><span style="color: red">-.039</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are really nice shorts but they were a bit larger and longer then expected.</mark> <mark class = "neg">These are really thick so they would be perfect for cooler weather but I felt they were too thick for summer.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The image is a bit deceiving in terms of length, the model in the image must be 6' tall with very long legs because I'm 5'7" and these shorts fall just above my knees.</mark> I would most definitely buy these again, just down one size.</p>
<h1>342: <em><span style="color: green">+.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I ordered 2XL based on some of the reviews, thinking... <mark class = "pos">for me and my big belly I might need to size up.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Nope nope - bad call on my part.</mark> <mark class = "neg">They are baggy in the crotch, the legs, all but the waist but there is so much stretch in the waist a normal XL or possibly even Large would have been fine.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric feels thick, the pockets are big enough for my big phone.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you got the right size and have a bit of a tummy I think it would hold you in.</mark> That's what I hoped for. <mark class = "neg">I am short, 5 ft tall and the shorts almost hit my knee.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Once I get the right size I think I will love them.</mark></p>
<h1>343: <em><span style="color: green">+.372</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I absolutely LOVE these!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I orginally bought them to wear under my Victorian dresses for reenactment, so I could have shorts and a pocket underneath.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Now I'm buying more and hopefully in various lengths!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am a plus size girl & the XXL is perfect!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are sooo comfy!</mark></p>
<h1>344: <em><span style="color: green">+.595</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I bought these shorts to use with my Wii Fit as I broke the leg strap and needed something that would register as the nunchuk in the leg strap.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It worked perfectly and is actually much more convenient than the leg strap which stretches out, does not stay put and does not register well...</mark> <mark class = "pos">Its really convenient and easier.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My only issue, the pants runs a tad big so I would order one size down other than that its a great alternative to the leg strap and great price.</mark></p>
<h1>345: <em><span style="color: red">-.012</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These shorts looked and felt great until I noticed that the seams on one leg and in the crotch started to split and run like a pair of pantyhose!</mark> <mark class = "neg">Thank goodness I wasn't in a compromising position.</mark> I only wore them two hours! I didn't notice any tummy control. <mark class = "pos">Maybe because they were a little loose fitting on me.</mark> If you're looking for a pair of shorts that will last a while, I don't think these are the way to go.</p>
<h1>346: <em><span style="color: red">-.022</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I bought these shorts because of a review that started they were not too long .</mark> <mark class = "neg">They hit my knees and the fit is also very loose.</mark> The fabric is very thin also . <mark class = "neg">I don't know if a smaller size would be shorter but hitting just above the knee makes them look and fit odd.</mark></p>
<h1>347: <em><span style="color: green">+.126</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I loved the first pair I bought so much that I ordered a 2nd pair.</mark> When I got the 2nd pair I realized they were not the same fabric as the first pair.

<h1>348: <em><span style="color: green">+.276</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Purchased for my mother who loves shorts but couldn't find anything she liked.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Well turns out she loves these and they are her go to shorts now!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Pocket features are a plus these shorts are great for work out walking biking or just leisure too.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Easy to put on makes them a better option for those who don't want to fuss with zippers or snaps or buttons.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My mom is in her 70's and she doesn't recall wearing shorts in years due to the lack of comfort or fit and now we're looking for more pairs !</mark></p>

<h1>350: <em><span style="color: green">+.236</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The waist keeps flipping over, and I ordered the size I normally wear in other active wear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I constantly had to pull them up to feel like they fit right.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They arent horrible, but might want to order a size bigger if you have any belly to you.</mark></p>
<h1>351: <em><span style="color: green">+.391</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I am 6 feet tall, and these shorts hit a few inches above the knee, for reference.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great quality.</mark> I wear a size 14 pants, and bought the L and XL to compare. <mark class = "pos">Both fit, but the L is the perfect fit (the XL was just a bit too loose in the hips for me).</mark></p>
<h1>352: <em><span style="color: green">+.327</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">They fit a little big I usually buy XL workout bottom from VS Sport so I got these in XL comfortable and breathable great for the summer.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are thin and see thru so definitely be mindful of the underwear you wearing with these</mark></p>

<h1>354: <em><span style="color: red">-.023</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are incredibly comfy and the pockets easily fit my iPhone.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The fabric (I got black) has a sheen to it.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I also use these for undershorts in skirts/dresses to prevent the dreaded "chub rub".</mark> Order whatever size you usually wear in yoga/workout pants.</p>
<h1>355: <em><span style="color: green">+.215</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I got the XL and I am 5'9" at 240 lbs. <mark class = "pos">These shorts fit great!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are high waisted as described and they come right above my knees maybe like 2 or 3 inches above my knee.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love the pockets too, these are so great for me because I hate carrying a bag around.</mark></p>

<h1>360: <em><span style="color: red">-.157</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">These were less expensive than other brands.</mark> <mark class = "neg">And the quality isn't as good.</mark> <mark class = "neg">So you get what you pay for.</mark> They do run large. <mark class = "neg">It says to hang them to dry.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I dried them in the dryer and there wasn't an issue.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I was hoping they would shrink up a bit, but no luck there.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The small pocket at the waste isn't sewn down into the bottom seam, so it doesn't stay put very well.</mark></p>
<h1>361: <em><span style="color: green">+.087</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I am a L/Xl so that's what I ordered because the reviews had been mixed. <mark class = "neg">I put my phone in my pocket and my pants fell off, multiple times.</mark> <mark class = "pos">now I know I didn't shrink in size but this will be great when I have my next baby.</mark></p>

<h1>820: <em><span style="color: red">-.027</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I purchased these to use to sleep in, lay around the house. <mark class = "pos">However, even at it's low price point, these sweats are TERRIBLE.</mark> They do run small. <mark class = "neg">The one and only pants seam is right down the inside of the leg, which is huge and makes it uncomfortable.</mark> <mark class = "neg">But the worst part about them is that they shed like CRAZY!</mark> <mark class = "neg">The morning after I first wore them to bed, when I showered, there was black fuzz everywhere.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The small bits of fleece got stuck all in my loofah sponge and it took me forever to remove it all.</mark> I've owned plenty of sweat pants before and this has never happened. <mark class = "pos">Spend a bit more for a better pair.</mark></p>

<h1>825: <em><span style="color: green">+.078</span></em></h1><p class="indented">They're extremely simple--no drawstring, no pockets--and very thin as far as "sweat pants" go, but what do you want for $10 bucks? I usually wear around a size 24. <mark class = "pos">I'm so glad that they come in petite!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I tried a 4X-petite because I'm a shortie (5'1" here!) and they're comfortably large on me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I will likely order another pair and I'm considering ordering a 3X-petite instead.</mark> <mark class = "neg">They are not so big that they are falling down, but I do step on the heels just a little bit because I really am just that short and the waist has enough room that I may be able to reduce a size.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I was hoping they'd shrink a bit in the wash but they don't have appeared to after their first washing, but they got washed in cold water this time.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I may intentionally wash them in hot next time and then I'll decide on the next size that I'll order.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I bought them strictly for pajama pants/lounge pants for around the house and they're great for that.</mark> I wouldn't wear these in public. <mark class = "neg">The legs are very wide and they're baggy and probably don't look flattering on me, but thankfully the crotch does not hang too low so they're comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They're sufficient for house pants.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Update: I washed them in hot water and they shrunk just a little bit and now fit me perfectly.</mark> I'll probably buy more. <mark class = "pos">I just really wish they had pockets!</mark></p>

<h1>827: <em><span style="color: green">+.368</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I broke and chipped some bones in my wrist, no zippers or buttons possible for me for quite some time.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These sweatpants have been a lifesaver.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wear them everywhere, to work, out to dinner, I literally cannot wear any other pants, and they look fine with sweaters, shirts, jackets.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are comfortable, easy to put on, good quality, wash really well and the fit is good.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I now have eight pairs hanging in my closet, couldn't live without them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love them so much, I may wear them forever.</mark></p>

<h1>830: <em><span style="color: red">-.064</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Two things I wish I had realized before I purchased these sweatpants, 1) There is no band around the bottom of the leg.</mark> I'm 5'3 and there is at least three inches of fabric under my feet.

<h1>831: <em><span style="color: red">-.001</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I have quite the internal struggle about these sweatpants.</mark> <mark class = "pos">On the one hand, they are extremely soft and comfortable, and the fleece is nice and warm.</mark> <mark class = "pos">On the other, that same warm fleece pills up like crazy!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Imagine the disappointment of pulling your sweatpants off and finding fuzzies all over your legs and thighs, and then needing to clean yourself off to get rid of said fuzzies (larger ladies like myself will hopefully relate - thighs rub together!).</mark> The fuzzies migrate down the pant legs too, so I find them on my socks, in my shoes, or on the floor. <mark class = "neg">Both pairs I bought do this, in spite of washing them a few times.</mark> <mark class = "neg">So sadly they'll be relegated to pajama bottoms for cold nights, instead of exercise pants as I'd hoped.</mark></p>
<h1>832: <em><span style="color: green">+.147</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I had no idea these would be so soft!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I think I'm in love.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They aren't fleece exactly, but the insides are fleecy and feel amazing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I bought these to use as pajamas so I dont really care what they look like, but they don't look half-bad either!</mark> <mark class = "neg">The material is thin and is therefore more flattering than my old bulky ones.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Yet, somehow these sweatpants manage to be MUCH warmer than any I've owned before.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm really happy I made this purchase.</mark> For the price, I just might buy several more pairs! <mark class = "neg">Note: I am 5'4" and the petites ARE an inch or two too long.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This always happens with me and sweatpants because I like them really loose and deliberately buy a size or two larger than I need.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I thought it was worth mentioning, though, since the length seems to be a concern for some of the other reviewers.</mark> <mark class = "neg">You might want to order petites even if you are average height and you might want to get a more snug size if you don't want the extra length.</mark> YMMV.</p>

<h1>834: <em><span style="color: green">+.139</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I used the size chart provided for this item, but the pants fit a full size too large.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I bought them in blue, black & purple & they all fit exactly the same.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It looks like you may want to go down a size when ordering, especially if you're between sizes - go with the smaller size, for sure.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material is very thick & warm, but the fleece inside sheds a lot until they've been washed 3 times or so.</mark></p>

<h1>842: <em><span style="color: green">+.135</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I got the regular rather than petite because I've had sweatpants shrink in the past.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Evidently the manufacturer heard the problem, because these didn't shrink at all after several washes.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love the softness and sturdier material, but I'm 5'2" and the pants are at least five inches too long.</mark> I'll be taking these up when I have time. <mark class = "pos">I love the feel of these pants so much I change into them when I get home from work.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Definitely a good buy, but don't allow for nonexistent shrinkage.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The gray color I chose hasn't faded at all, and these are nice enough to wear outside the house.</mark></p>

<h1>846: <em><span style="color: green">+.262</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I'm 5'3 and am a size 22 so I bought a 3x petite.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These pants are super comfy and so soft on the inside.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit perfectly around my waist but are baggy everywhere else.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These fit like wide legs.</mark> I was expecting them not to be so baggy but I bought these to lounge around my house so I don't mind. <mark class = "pos">They wash and wear nicely too.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I haven't had any problems with shrinking.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The pant legs still drag a bit even with shoes on but they don't go under my heels so if you're short like me expect the same problem.</mark></p>
<h1>847: <em><span style="color: red">-.213</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I know I'm a little short at only 5 ft 5 but I didn't expect that when the crotch of these pants was in the right place, the waist was up to my bust.</mark> I ordered size 3x based on manufacturer's size chart. <mark class = "neg">If I ignore the placement of the crotch and put the waist in the right place, that fits all right but then the legs are roughly 7-8 inches too long.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Sadly, I live outside the U.S., so it's not worth the cost to return / replace.</mark></p>

<h1>850: <em><span style="color: green">+.206</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I bought a 5x because 4x womens are always sometimes off. <mark class = "pos">To my surprise, the 5x is a bit too big.</mark> For the price, I'm keeping them because I haven't run through the wash yet so I don't know if they are going to shrink. <mark class = "pos">I'm very happy with my purchase I only wear these around the house so it's perfect for me.</mark></p>
<h1>851: <em><span style="color: green">+.135</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I purchased these to wear while recovering from a broken ankle.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I ordered a size larger than normal so they would slip on easily and cover the knee-high walking boot.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are soft and warm (though they do leave a lot of fuzz first couple of times washing).</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very comfortable, and the price was good.</mark></p>
<h1>852: <em><span style="color: green">+.198</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fabric is super soft and fit is great.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Only thing I would prefer is a drawstring because my waist size is smaller than pants size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But the elastic it these do seem to do a good job without being too tight.</mark> Will buy again for sure.

<h1>853: <em><span style="color: green">+.467</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fabric is nice and cozy, seems well put together.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They run a bit small, I ordered a 2X which is what I have worn for years, but these seem a bit on the small side-if I thought they were supposed to fit "snug" I would be happy, but I like my sweats/ joggers/ lounge-wear to be loose and comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I think I will give them to a friend who is a little smaller than I am and likes her clothes to fit more snugly than I do.</mark></p>
<h1>854: <em><span style="color: green">+.357</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are so comfortable!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are easy to slip into after water aerobics and the soft, inside fabric feels warm, but not too hot.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I just wish they had pockets.</mark></p>
<h1>855: <em><span style="color: red">-.128</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I just cannot understand why some clothing manufacturers think large women are all 6 feet tall.</mark> <mark class = "neg">These pants are at least 5 inches too long.</mark> I am 5'6" inches tall and have average length legs.

<h1>856: <em><span style="color: green">+.043</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Perfect pants for a lazy Sunday. <mark class = "pos">I own several pairs of these sweatpants in various colors, and they are great pajama bottoms for the cold icy frigid New England winters.</mark> <mark class = "pos">We just recently got back from visiting friends in northern Maine, and, truth be told, I did have to wear long underwear with them (is seventeen below cold?</mark> Bob didn't seem to think so . . <mark class = "pos">.)

<h1>858: <em><span style="color: green">+.220</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Perfect for my use except that they are too large.</mark> Will try to order a smaller size. <mark class = "pos">Perfect for running around doing errands,
going to physical therapy, etc....</mark> <mark class = "neg">2nd pair I ordered are still a little large BUT I ran them through a hot water cycle and think that helped a little.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The Petite length
is much better for me.</mark> Do not have to have them hemmed. <mark class = "pos">These pants are perfect for my use at this time.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Thank you.</mark></p>
<h1>859: <em><span style="color: green">+.219</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Even buying a size down, the sweats were still too big.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Thank goodness for elastic around the ankles to keep the pants from dragging on the ground for this very short person.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The elastic is very nice and loose and does not bind around the ankles so it is very comfortable.</mark></p>
<h1>860: <em><span style="color: green">+.182</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The wide waist band is great!</mark> I purchased a 3X. <mark class = "pos">The legs are extremely roomy for me as my thighs are not very full.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The waist is really forgiving on size and I'm considering purchasing a 2X. A 4X gal may find this a nice fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The length is pretty long.</mark> When sitting, the hems come to my ankles, and when when standing they come to about 1/2 inch from the floor. <mark class = "neg">I'm 5'7" tall and it's hard for me to find casual pants that are long enough.</mark></p>
<h1>861: <em><span style="color: green">+.219</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Received sweatpants last week.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit well.</mark> However, after wearing one time the stitching in the crotch area came out.

<h1>862: <em><span style="color: green">+.171</span></em></h1><p class="indented">They were a bit tight for my taste in the thigh area. Fabric is thick. <mark class = "pos">I prefer more breathable fabric, but I still wear them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I appreciate that they are not too long.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Often pants for large figured women are too long, so I then have to buy their petite length, but these are perfect length.</mark></p>
<h1>863: <em><span style="color: green">+.103</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The reviews weren't too exciting and I read the sizing was off.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I ordered what I usually do and they were perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">When they arrived, I was afraid they would not be very warm as they appeared to be kind of thin, but after washing and drying, they fluffed right up.</mark> <mark class = "neg">This is the first cold weather we've had and I'll be picking a pair of these out of the closet to wear today.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Love the fact that these have a straight leg.</mark></p>
<h1>864: <em><span style="color: red">-.040</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">These need an elastic strip at the ankle to keep them from dragging on the floor.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I have to roll them up to prevent the drag...</mark> <mark class = "neg">It just looks tacky!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Also, just a few extra inches more material needed for the "back rise".</mark> <mark class = "pos">The front rise is fine.</mark></p>
<h1>865: <em><span style="color: green">+.015</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I am disabled and needed a pair of pants that were warm and that I could just pull on.</mark> Just My Size were everything I wanted.. I wear a 3X and they were true to size. Pants are a little on the long size..

<h1>866: <em><span style="color: green">+.187</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I bought a pair of these a few years ago and loved them - they wore out so I hunted for them and found them here - they are a good weight and the fleece makes them cozy, but no too warm.</mark> These are not heavy duty sweatpants. <mark class = "pos">The outside fabric does pill easily and the fleece "sheds" a little during the first few wearings, but they are a good buy.</mark></p>
<h1>867: <em><span style="color: green">+.172</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Baggy fit that shrinks just a bit with multiple washes.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Warm and soft for winter.</mark> No pilling as of yet. <mark class = "pos">high waisted so I just fold the elastic down over the top of the pant , one turn.</mark> With the baggy leg, U might catch a draft up your leg.</p>
<h1>868: <em><span style="color: green">+.040</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I have been purchasing these pants for years and they now seem to have a different sizing. <mark class = "neg">The 1st pair I bought was a bit snug and I figured they would be tighter after washing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So I ordered the next size up and they seem a bit big but I haven't washed them yet so I think they will now be fine.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Nice looking and I think they will hold up well to repeated washing.</mark></p>
<h1>869: <em><span style="color: red">-.079</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Ordered a 2xl because said they run small. Usually wear an XL. <mark class = "neg">The pair I got were about 3" too long and baggy.</mark> I'm 5,1 154 #.</p>
<h1>870: <em><span style="color: green">+.362</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These are perfect for me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Nice leg length so they aren't too short at the ankle when you sit.</mark> They hide my striped sock fashion crimes. <mark class = "pos">They are plenty loose but not too baggy and the ankle is tapered but not too much.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Also, they were inexpensive.</mark></p>
<h1>871: <em><span style="color: red">-.216</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">These were nice to lounge around the house or if I had to run out for errands but I accidentally put them in the dryer and they shrunk ALOT so I guess now they'll just be worn around the house because they're way to tight</mark></p>
<h1>872: <em><span style="color: green">+.212</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Bought these for my mom, she does Peritoneal Dialysis at home, so she carries extra fluid in her tummy at all times.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I wanted something that would be comfortable, and soft, but not be so big that it impedes her as she walks.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These sweats are perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Loose enough to not bother her tummy, and right enough to stay in place.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Very soft on the inside and she loves the color.</mark> Will absolutely buy these again. :)</p>

<h1>1646: <em><span style="color: green">+.230</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Being a plus size girl, it's next to impossible to find work out clothes that are reasonably priced.</mark> Even harder to find them in stores. <mark class = "pos">I know my size in the Just My Size brand so I was confident in ordering these on line.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit, but the waist and hip area is tighter than normal, and I would feel more comfortable if the rise was a little longer, but they don't show my crack when I bend over so I'll keep them</mark></p>
<h1>1647: <em><span style="color: green">+.452</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I like these pants but was a little surprised at the waist.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fit of the actual pants is fine, but the band of elastic at the waist cinched in more than I'd expect given the size I ordered.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It was distracting enough when sitting on an exercise bike that I had to take a quick break to hit the locker room and physically stretch the band out a bit!</mark> <mark class = "pos">It loosened just enough so I wasn't distracted or pinched anymore, but also convinced me that the pants were better sewn/made than I'd expect given the price - the stitching and fabric were unaffected by my warping of the one tight strap of elastic inside.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Overall, I'm very pleased!</mark></p>
<h1>1648: <em><span style="color: green">+.157</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Good fit over my oddly-shaped body.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have a short inseam so these were down to my ankles but they were perfectly comfortable with me hiking them up to my knees.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Covered my butt and belly just great and didn't roll down during exercise.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Fabric was cool and light.</mark> I am a 24/26 in bottoms and got the 4X.</p>
<h1>1649: <em><span style="color: green">+.092</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These had a good rating so thought I would try them.</mark> I am a size 18W normal clothes, so ordered a 1x. <mark class = "pos">The fit was perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I do not understand why others are saying they do not run true to size, as they do.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The capris were the nice matte stretchy cotton, not the shiny type I hate.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material was a little thin for my liking, but did not seem see thru.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I did not like the waist band.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It looked like someone stitched the top down and then inserted an elastic band.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It was very flimsy and had NO compression on the belly so was not happy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">When I bend over, the top kind of rolls down.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I was going to return them, but decided to keep them to use for hanging around the house pants.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They really are nice looking and the price was only $13, so the comfort made me keep them.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Not good for working out though if you need the compression waist band to hold the gut it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I would not buy these again, but gave them a 4 star rating because they are cheap, cute and comfortable.</mark></p>
<h1>1650: <em><span style="color: green">+.199</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I actually really love the material.</mark> <mark class = "neg">My thighs run together so leggings typically do not last long for me as the friction begins to tear them apart.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These aren't extremely cotton and have a nice stretchy feel.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The quality is great for the price.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are kinda big.</mark> I may have over estimated my own size so I can't hold it against the leggings. <mark class = "neg">But they aren't too big.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I still wear them to the gym and they fit my legs and butt just fine.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love the little white on the sides and I'm a big fan of the cropped leggings look.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Will probably purchase another pair in a bit smaller size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But so far they are a really nice quality pair of leggings.</mark></p>
<h1>1651: <em><span style="color: green">+.117</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">When I started to put them on my legs, I thought they would be too small, but they fit very well--not too loose or too tight.</mark> When I ordered them, I thought they had a pocket on the side panel to hold my phone, but they don't. <mark class = "pos">Still, they are comfortable and look good</mark></p>
<h1>1652: <em><span style="color: green">+.224</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I am always skeptical about buying clothes online.</mark> Especially because I am chubby. <mark class = "pos">I went ahead and purchased these and I am so happy I did.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit great.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are comfortable and will do well for me.</mark></p>
<h1>1653: <em><span style="color: green">+.194</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I originally bought a 3x and it was so loose that it slipped down.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Which I was happily surprised because I almost always have to size up.</mark> So I returned and got a 2x, could even do a 1x maybe. <mark class = "pos">They fit perfectly and keep me all held in and smooth.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Plus they are so pretty and cool.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These are my preferred capris.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They can be dressed up with a nice blouse as well as just workout/lounge wear.</mark> Will be buying in more colors. <mark class = "neg">Wish they had pockets but the way they fit and look, the lack of pockets can be excused.</mark></p>
<h1>1654: <em><span style="color: green">+.047</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I got the 4x and need to trade for a 3x.

<h1>1937: <em><span style="color: green">+.161</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I normally wear a size xl, 2x if I want something to be loose and comfy.</mark> Because of other feedback stating these run small, I ordered the size 3x. <mark class = "pos">They fit like I would expect a 2x to fit, very loose..</mark> <mark class = "pos">I bought three of them to wear when I work out in the yard.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are very lightweight and comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I hope they do shrink a bit when I wash them because they are very roomy, but if not, no harm.</mark> <mark class = "pos">For the price, well worth the purchase.</mark> I'm 5'8" and the length is as pictured. <mark class = "pos">They cover the behind and front and look fine with leggings.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I really like the shirt tale bottom, too.</mark> UPDATE: I have now washed these and they do shrink a bit. <mark class = "pos">The 3X now fits much better.</mark> However, I since ordered 2 more of these at the 'add on item" price. Watch your cart. <mark class = "pos">They were $3.85 when I put them in the cart but when I checked out, they had apparently increased the price, as I was charged $4.99 for each one.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Still a good price for a cheap shirt to work outside in, but so irritating..</mark> This happens a lot on Amazon. <mark class = "neg">The constant price changes are frustrating.</mark></p>
<h1>1938: <em><span style="color: green">+.021</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Was hoping for a shirt with more wiggle room and not a snug fit.</mark> I am a busty lady and this size does not accomodate that.

<h1>1939: <em><span style="color: green">+.043</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">This is a simple, cheap longer-length tank good for around the house and exercising.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I bought it first in briny pink (a really pretty, flattering color for us olive-skinned gals).</mark> I have it in 4 other colors now. This is nothing earth-shaking. <mark class = "pos">You put it on, do your workout or just lounge around with it on warm days (cool as it's cotton and sleeveless).</mark> I wouldn't overdry this. <mark class = "pos">Also, look at the size chart CAREFULLY and then probably still size up.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I normally wear 18W or 20W (unless it's a runs-smaller designer brand).</mark> I usually wear 2x.

<h1>2002: <em><span style="color: red">-.067</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I bought this in several colors. <mark class = "neg">One arrived with a hole at the neckline where it wasn't sewn correctly.</mark> Another developed a similar hole after the first washing. <mark class = "pos">I suspect they aren't going to hold their shape long either.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Seems like cheap material, and cheaply made.</mark></p>
<h1>2003: <em><span style="color: green">+.173</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Most clothes I order online are usually too small or too big.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This one surprised me as being a PERFECT fit!</mark> <mark class = "neg">The material is soft and not clingy like some shirts I've gotten online from other brands.</mark> As soon as my check comes in next month, I plan to order another one!! <mark class = "pos">I LOVE IT!!</mark></p>
<h1>2004: <em><span style="color: green">+.079</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">So loose and low and I am a C cup so this is not normal, yet quite tight at the waist.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I am too lazy to just send back since it was so cheap.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I now have a new cleaning rag.</mark></p>
<h1>2005: <em><span style="color: green">+.176</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Great to be at home.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is soft and breathable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love it, and I'm ordering more in different colors.</mark> It runs small.</p>

<h1>2007: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">It's very pink pink in my opinion and the size? a little small for a 4x. It contains no spandex in it so there is no give. It's like a t-shirt material but light.</p>
<h1>2008: <em><span style="color: green">+.273</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These fit me where so many tanks don't in 2XL - usually the armholes are enormous and I am not gifted in the chest.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is great in hot, steamy Florida.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The overall fit is great for my apple shape.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Price is good.</mark></p>
<h1>2009: <em><span style="color: green">+.165</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The fit of this shirt is perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Not tight, long enough to keep your back covered, and as soft as can be.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The wicking material really works as I only wake up sweating from my head and neck.</mark> No more soaking the sheets! <mark class = "pos">I have bought numerous of these and they are worth every cent.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I hope they keep them in stock for a long time.</mark></p>
<h1>2010: <em><span style="color: green">+.195</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I used this to iron on a T-shirt transfer and it worked very well.</mark> The fabric is a little thin so I will wear a camisole underneath. <mark class = "pos">Considering it is white that is okay.</mark> I would buy again. <mark class = "pos">Good value for the price.</mark></p>
<h1>2011: <em><span style="color: red">-.500</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Nice enough - but they combined an x-l and 1x and it's just too small.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Disappointed.</mark></p>
<h1>2012: <em><span style="color: red">-.153</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The purple color is harsh (my bad).</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm going to keep it because the fit and quality are fine and I hate returns.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Purchased to go under a baggy sweater, anyway, so I'll just completely cover it up with a sweatshirt when it gets cold.</mark></p>
<h1>2013: <em><span style="color: green">+1.047</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I was very happy with the tops.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit a little loose, but not too much so.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material is just right.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The tops are very comfortable.</mark></p>
<h1>2014: <em><span style="color: green">+.012</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I purchased the black tank top to use under button up sweaters.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I really like how it fits, it's not too tight.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However, I have two white cats and this tank top, after one day of use, is completely covered in all the hair they have shed for the past three months.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It's a ridiculous amount of cat hair.</mark> <mark class = "neg">As a cat owner, I've come to expect a certain amount of hair to be permanently affixed to my clothing, but I'm not sure I can even rightly call this tank top black anymore!</mark></p>
<h1>2015: <em><span style="color: red">-.245</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">These tanks are awful!</mark> They are plus size but run 1 size too small. The whole point of ordering plus size is to make sure it fits. <mark class = "neg">I am between an XL and 1 X due to being overweight and having a big chest.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This shirt cannot possibly be a true size 1X because all my other 1x tops are too loose.</mark> <mark class = "neg">So disappointed!</mark></p>
<h1>2016: <em><span style="color: green">+.326</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The color, in person, is very pretty and wears like a charm.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I love that it's cotton.</mark> <mark class = "neg">There's enough room around the middle that I'm not always pulling at it.</mark> It fits just on my upper thigh and covers everything that I need covered.</p>
<h1>2017: <em><span style="color: green">+.163</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fits well.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Underarms are not so big that it shows lots of skin.</mark> This shirt hits below my rear end and completely covers it but I'm short (4'10) so on a taller person it might not completely cover it.</p>
<h1>2018: <em><span style="color: green">+.047</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Bought Tank tops to wear for exercising and for power walk and light jogging. <mark class = "pos">I bought in my size and it fits perfectly and it was xl.</mark> I tend to wear them over my sport bra in early spring outside. <mark class = "pos">They fit perfectly in my chest area with no loose fit.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The waist and hip area can sometimes be a little loose at first but will shrink a bit after a wash.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I love these tanks for the price and have gone through multiple washings.</mark></p>
<h1>2019: <em><span style="color: green">+.073</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">It's far more bubble-gum pink than pale pink.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Not like pictured.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But comfy and will just be wearing these around the house.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So I won't bother returning...</mark> but definitely not the color pictured.</p>

<h1>2021: <em><span style="color: green">+.097</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Love it !,bought a 2x plenty room under tha arm pit without showing your bra.</mark> I'm 200# 5'6" material isn't to think or to thick.</p>
<h1>2022: <em><span style="color: red">-.177</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Returned both that I purchased. <mark class = "neg">Poor quality, too large.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The material is very this and in my opinion not worth the price.</mark> Purchased to wear knocking about the house and couldn't get out yet post op.</p>
<h1>2023: <em><span style="color: green">+.510</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Love that its cotton, great construction!</mark></p>
<h1>2024: <em><span style="color: red">-.040</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Not really happy with the fit but I can regift it so it's okay</mark></p>
<h1>2025: <em><span style="color: green">+.086</span></em></h1><p class="indented">The shirt was just as described in the ad. <mark class = "pos">Fits great and it did state it was lightweight fabric.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I've washed it several times with no issues.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Only problem is that it wrinkles easily while wearing.</mark> But that's 100% cotton for u.</p>
<h1>2026: <em><span style="color: green">+.218</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">After experimenting with 3 different sizes I found that the 3X was what I needed.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Nice fabric and good length.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Not too big in the armholes but definitely size up at least 1 if not 2 sizes.</mark></p>
<h1>2027: <em><span style="color: green">+.417</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Soft fabric, very comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I bought a little bigger to accommodate me with right shoulder surgery.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I normally like my tops a little loose and this size was great for both of my needs.</mark></p>
<h1>2028: <em><span style="color: green">+.070</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Was surprised this is just a thick cotton tank top. <mark class = "pos">My fault for not reading what the product was made of.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I just assumed a workout top would be made of something lighter or sweat wicking.</mark></p>
<h1>2029: <em><span style="color: green">+.793</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Super comfy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Long enough to where I can relax and not have to worry about things hanging out where they shouldn't
Able to use with mix and match to look classy and still feel comfy.</mark></p>
<h1>2030: <em><span style="color: green">+.186</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I bought this tank in white.</mark> It is a good, solid, basic tank to wear under sweaters, shirts that are too see-through, or lacy tees/sweaters. <mark class = "pos">Seems well made, and washed well in warm water with normal dry.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I think it will hold up well with use and it is not a thin material so I feel it offers good coverage.</mark></p>
<h1>2031: <em><span style="color: green">+.207</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">These tees are so great!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I ended up ordering 4 of these White ones.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I wear them under many of my tops, and alone when it's really hot outside.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Great for working in the garden or yard.</mark></p>
<h1>2032: <em><span style="color: red">-.067</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I am busty. <mark class = "neg">Almost every single shirt I own, from different manufacturers, is a 1x.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wanted a tank top that would be extra roomy, so I bought a 2x.</mark> It just fits. <mark class = "neg">Being 100% cotton, I will have to wash it in cold water and hang it up to dry.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Considering I got it on sale for $6.99, it's worth the money, but I'm disappointed that I did not get what I was expecting.</mark></p>
<h1>2033: <em><span style="color: green">+.257</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I wear a 4x in things I buy from other women's catalogs and they fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This fit my sister who usually wears a 3x.</mark> Too tight across the stomach and hips. <mark class = "pos">Bust was a little loose but that might have fit better if it fit lower down.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you are going to make clothes for a big woman, design them for a big woman.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Not bigger versions of Misses.</mark> We aren't built the same. <mark class = "pos">I did like that it fit right under the arms.</mark></p>
<h1>2034: <em><span style="color: red">-.207</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">the size chart is wrong; the measurements do not match the sizes advertised.</mark> Buy one size up. <mark class = "neg">What a disappointment, and now the price has been jacked up $2.50 for a super-basic tank top or I would have bought more (in a larger size)</mark></p>
<h1>2035: <em><span style="color: green">+.008</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">This tank is okay.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I bought it to wear under my work shirts but after two washes it's too short to tuck in to my work pants.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm 5'9 so if you're shorter you may have better luck.</mark> It is definitely not tall as advertised. Must be made in China.</p>
<h1>2036: <em><span style="color: green">+.073</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Material was thinner than I expected and the fit a little larger and longer than I was used to getting with Just My Size.</mark> I will only wear it under something else. Feels too see through to wear by itself.</p>
<h1>2037: <em><span style="color: green">+.233</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Smaller than sized, seams unraveling right out of package.</mark></p>
<h1>2038: <em><span style="color: green">+.071</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I like the fit of the shirt overall.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I am a big busted and large hipped woman, with relatively small arms, so I like that it fits over the large parts, but doesn't have huge arm holes.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The fabric is not amazing, but it is light weight, and as long as I don't put it in the dryer it seems to be keeping it's shape.</mark></p>
<h1>2039: <em><span style="color: green">+.288</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">My new favorite tank tops!</mark> I bought one in almost every color. <mark class = "neg">The arm holes aren't huge like other tank tops I've tried in my size.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm not large chested (38B) so many shirt in my size are huge at the top.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm a size 16 (XL-XXL) in most shirts and these fit GREAT. I ordered a size 16W/1X. I'll buy them again for next summer!</mark></p>
<h1>2040: <em><span style="color: green">+.138</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">For reference, I'm a 14/16 and lean towards 14 in most clothes.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I went up a size after reading reviews and the XXL is still to small, I don't feel very comfortable in this.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The color was great though.</mark></p>
<h1>2041: <em><span style="color: green">+.084</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The tank top fits well.</mark> However I'm not a fan of the material they use for the stitching around the arms. <mark class = "neg">It feels rough and uncomfortable, while the rest of the tank top is soft.</mark></p>
<h1>2042: <em><span style="color: green">+.301</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I originally ordered a 1X as I like my shirts loose fitting, had to return it for a 2X so order up.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The length is good and quality material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wore it over a tank top to the races and it wasn't too bulky and breathed well in the 80 degree heat.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have since ordered 3 more as I really like how it fits now.</mark></p>
<h1>2043: <em><span style="color: green">+.160</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Very nice little basic tank top here.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Good weight that will allow you to dress it up with a nice blazer or a leather jacket or dress it down for a work out.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The rounded end softened your shape and I can see it being a staple in my closet.</mark> Definitely getting more because it's a price you can't beat. Make sure you use your measurements though! <mark class = "pos">I used their size chart and the fit was great.</mark></p>
<h1>2044: <em><span style="color: green">+.210</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I read some reviews and as a result, ordered a size larger than my usual.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It fits well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The petal purple is beautiful and true to color.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I ordered the process blue and it is MUCH brighter than shown.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Disappointed, but I will still wear it, just not how I had planned.</mark></p>
<h1>2045: <em><span style="color: green">+.031</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I gave a 5 star because it was a great short.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If I would have bought the right size, I would have kept it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My fault I didn't pay attention to the size I ordered.</mark></p>
<h1>2046: <em><span style="color: red">-.347</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I washed the tank tops (I bought a black and a white) and they look terrible, I have not even worn them yet.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I know the price was on $6.50 per top but they are not worth the money.</mark></p>
<h1>2047: <em><span style="color: green">+.058</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I normally buy large to extra large because I like free-flowing shirts, don't like them tight fitting especially around my belly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">This blouse is tight fitting but fits.</mark> I am 5'2 140 lbs and a 36D chest.</p>
<h1>2048: <em><span style="color: green">+.486</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fabric was thinner than I expected, but for the price cant go wrong.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Found for me the top was somewhat too small.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Wearable under a top shirt.</mark></p>
<h1>2049: <em><span style="color: green">+.418</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Super comfortable top- great pricing- made with quality.</mark> I got this for 7 dollars and change on Amazon. <mark class = "neg">For that price you can't afford to NOT get this great deal :-)</mark></p>
<h1>2050: <em><span style="color: green">+.341</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fits well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Piping on seams at arm holes is an unexpected bonus.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I don't often wear it alone (button down shirt over top).</mark> Except for sleeping. <mark class = "pos">So nice to have sleeveless to help keep cool.</mark></p>
<h1>2051: <em><span style="color: green">+.187</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Shrunk after washing, glad I ordered 1 size up.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Super soft and didn't bleed or fade.</mark> A review should not have a minimum number of words.</p>
<h1>2052: <em><span style="color: green">+.793</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The pink is actually a good deal more intense, which makes it kind of funny for what I bought it to go with - but hey it was a great price and it's a pretty color, so I'll wear it just the same!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Nice quality and a good neckline, good fabric which drapes well too!</mark></p>
<h1>2053: <em><span style="color: green">+.205</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Really like them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I only ordered 2 to see at first how they would fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I was looking for a little bit longer tank that wasn't too tight but not to loose either.</mark> Exactly what I was looking for to wear on my walks.</p>

<h1>2890: <em><span style="color: green">+.201</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">As some have mentioned the cotton material is a bit thin but that's ok with me, the 100% cotton will be very cool during the hot summer.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I wouldn't order it in white or light pink because I suspect bra and pant line would show thru.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's very soft and does not cling.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I usually wear a 4x but ordered a 5x because I wanted it to fit loosely which it does, might gape a bit under the arm.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like the long length, it covers everything.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It hangs past my bottom in the rear and comes to the top of my thigh in the front.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am very happy with the purchase!!</mark></p>
<h1>2891: <em><span style="color: green">+.223</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Ordered 2 to wear under sweaters/winter shirts. <mark class = "pos">Love them and will be ordering other colors.</mark> The hem dips just emough to add a bit of style and coverage. <mark class = "pos">Fit me fine but I was looking for more of a streamlined fit that still looks good on its own and not too tight (with the thought of being able to wear once summer comes too).</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are also comfy.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I washed and dried on low, came out fine.</mark></p>
<h1>2892: <em><span style="color: green">+.064</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I really would normally wear a 1x, but several of the Just My Size 1x's I've bought were also all cotton, and shrunk enough that it got a bit shorter, and closer to my body.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like them loose, so it won't show my rolls.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It is really way too big as a 3x, but I'm going to wash it before I wear it, and I'm sure that it will either be perfect, or only slightly too big after washing.</mark> Still, if I ordered it again, I might go for a 2x.</p>
<h1>2893: <em><span style="color: green">+.299</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Decent basic black tank for the price - but pic looks much nicer than it is.</mark> <mark class = "pos">In the pic, it looks like a nice shell that might consider wearing under another nicer shirt.</mark> <mark class = "neg">In reality - this is a thick cotton tank that is basically t shirt material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">All good if that's what you're looking for.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But if you were hoping for something nicer - this is not it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">That said - price is pretty cheap so just confirm that we get what we pay for.</mark></p>

<h1>2964: <em><span style="color: green">+.182</span></em></h1><p class="indented">these tees were exactly what I was looking for, I bought three and then after wearing and washing for a whiles went back and bought more. <mark class = "pos">they fit SNUG which is what i wanted, but for ladies with larger breasts they might want to order a size up.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have modest to normal sized breasts so, no problem there with the fit.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wanted some colorful tees to wear layered under sweaters for winter, under other tops for fall and spring, alone for evenings in summer and these are PERFECT for those purposes!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Because of the snug fit, the work GREAT under other tops for layering.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Even tops that are marked as the same size as these.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The colors are bright and coordinate with most of my clothes.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The fabric is soft and hasn't shrunk with warm water wash and a hot dryer, no fading yet either.</mark> Price can't be beat too.</p>

<h1>2967: <em><span style="color: red">-.029</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Material is very thin. I would not wear it in public.

<h1>2976: <em><span style="color: green">+.016</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">You can never have enough simple black tops.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I ordered this one a little bit large and it is as roomy and comfortable as I expected.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I hate tight clothes.</mark> I can wear with my pajama bottoms or jeans if I am leaving the house. <mark class = "neg">It's just a no fuss top and the v neck makes it look a little nicer than just a plain crew neck.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I am pleased with my purchase.</mark></p>

<h1>2982: <em><span style="color: green">+.062</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">The fit is good, I particularly like the neckline.</mark> The material does not breathe though.

I recommend this because it seems quality, but I would size up at least twice if you want that looser fit that I was looking for.</mark></p>

<h1>3610: <em><span style="color: green">+.318</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Ordered a size up and it fit great.</mark></p>
<h1>3611: <em><span style="color: green">+.084</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">They are very similar to the Danskin yoga pants I've worn for years similar weight and feel.</mark> Not exact though. Close. <mark class = "pos">A couple of the other reviews commented on them being a bit snug but that it wasn't an issue for most people.</mark> I ordered an XL which is the size of my Danskin and in the Naviskin they are snug. The waist stitching was tight. <mark class = "pos">I also purchased an XXL which is perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So be mindful to order up if you want to be a teeny looser.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I am keeping both and saving the XL for my skinny days.</mark></p>
<h1>3612: <em><span style="color: red">-.002</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I really like these yoga pants.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Cotton is the most comfortable breathable fabric, it doesn't pill or attract fuzz and pet hair.</mark> <mark class = "neg">The fit of the XL petite was not great for me, I am 5'3" 33-waist, 41-hips.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They were a bit big in the waist and just a tad short with sneakers.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If they don't shrink at all, which is unlikely, they are wearable.</mark> I am considering the Large regular length instead.</p>
<h1>3613: <em><span style="color: green">+.166</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I have tried many different yoga pants (and others too) for a trip we are taking. <mark class = "pos">I absolutely love these!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They fit great (I would suggest ordering a size up) and I love the pockets!</mark> I am 5'1", 170 lbs. I ordered the 29" inseam in size XL just for those who need a size reference...</p>
<h1>3614: <em><span style="color: green">+.111</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Finally truly LONG leg yoga pants.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Really almost too long but since the fabric is 92% cotton I expect them to shrink some in the wash so I'll update after washing them.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Thin but not see through these are great for hot weather and with the right shoes and to you could easily wear them out to casual dress situations.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Back pockets are handy but may be too small for some cell phones.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They have a really nice flow and drape to the legs and look great on long legged individuals</mark></p>
<h1>3615: <em><span style="color: green">+.034</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I gave this a 2 because the color and feel of the pants seem like they'd be comfortable.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Now I ordered an extra large and that is what I wear at the stores sometimes i can fit in a large.</mark> <mark class = "neg">These came saying extra large but are definitely a medium size i cant get them past my thighs so I will have to lose weight before wearing them which sucks cuz I was hoping to be able to wear them.</mark> So with this being said buy them 2 sizes bigger than you wear unless you are tiny.</p>
<h1>3616: <em><span style="color: green">+.268</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Recommend.</mark> <mark class = "pos">These pants are really good.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They feel and look like cotton with some stretch.</mark> <mark class = "pos">However, there is no semblance of a tummy control panel.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Pockets, I don't care about so I won't comment, except to say there is at least one back pocket.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like the quality very much.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They don't seem to fade or lose shape easily.</mark> (I bought them in June). <mark class = "pos">The big thing for me though, is that they FIT. I am 5'2 and have managed to develop quite some hips, gut, and buttocks.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I bought the XL, 29 inch inseam, and they fit perfectly.</mark> As I said, no tummy control at all... So I am reordering today, and might go down a size. <mark class = "neg">It would be great if these came in more colors!</mark></p>
<h1>3617: <em><span style="color: green">+.249</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I loved the fit and feel of these pants and was planning to get more of them until the second time I wore them, when I realized there was a hole in the butt along the seam.</mark> <mark class = "pos">My pants usually last for years so this speaks pretty poorly of the quality.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Hoping that maybe it was a fluke thing and the company would make it right I emailed them but I have received no response.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Better to keep looking and find a better option.</mark> I know I will.</p>
<h1>3618: <em><span style="color: red">-.059</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I couldn't even bring myself to try these on because the fabric was like sweat pants. <mark class = "neg">The other disappointment was the BOLD WHITE label on the butt that there's no way to remove.</mark> I sent these back immediately, they could not serve the purpose I purchased them for. <mark class = "neg">If you want these for hiking or dog walking they would be suitable.</mark></p>
<h1>3619: <em><span style="color: red">-.050</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">The pants fit great except I was not shipped petite so they were too long and had to be hemmed.</mark> I could not return them because I had take the tags on and put them on. <mark class = "neg">It was at that time I realized they were not petite.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Maybe you can give me a discount on my next pair, that would be nice since they weren't a petite size like I ordered.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Many thanks</mark></p>
<h1>3620: <em><span style="color: green">+.102</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I literally wear these pants every day. I look for cotton pants because I am a farmer and I cannot wear latex or vinyl all day or any other elastic synthetic blends.

<h1>5074: <em><span style="color: green">+.350</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I found these athletic capris to be very well made and perfect for exercising (power walking and strength training) and sports (volleyball and yoga).</mark> <mark class = "pos">The fabric is soft, flexible, well-tailored, and rich in color.</mark> I bought the purple, grey, and blue pairs in an XL (I usually wear L, so you'll want to size up). <mark class = "neg">I also bought the long workout style in black.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They perform as well and look just as good as their expensive brand-name counterparts.</mark> And you can't beat the price! <mark class = "pos">The shipping was fast and my first return (exchange the large for XL) was seamless.</mark></p>

<h1>5077: <em><span style="color: green">+.077</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I ordered a size up because the last pair I bought ran small. <mark class = "pos">These run a little big.</mark> There is also no compression or shaping.

Underwear line is visible
Thin line of elastic rolls during squats</mark></p>

Normally wear a 38DD-DDD. <mark class = "pos">The 'over shirt', while pretty loose in the chest area, is not loose in the middle area.</mark> It just fits. <mark class = "pos">So if you've got a little middle, it'll be loose, like the picture.</mark> <mark class = "neg">But if you carry any of your weight in your middle area, while not 'skin tight', it's definitely not going to be 'loose fitting' like on the models.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Overall, I like them (I ordered the 2- pack).</mark> <mark class = "pos">They're encouraging me to trim up a bit in my middle section lol.</mark> Sports bra is typical material. <mark class = "pos">The over shirt I'm not sure, polyester of some kind I think.</mark> It's thin, but I'm not wearing these for a fashion show. <mark class = "pos">For around the house or light exercise, they're great.</mark></p>
<h1>5102: <em><span style="color: green">+.176</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Love it!</mark> <mark class = "neg">I bought the lime green in size XL.

<h1>5103: <em><span style="color: green">+.265</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I did not read any reviews and purchased this top thinking it was true to size.</mark> I am a an X large and that's what I ordered. It was too small. <mark class = "pos">When I brought this to the seller's attention, I received an XX large and it fit perfectly.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The material and workmanship is great and the color is exactly as shown.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm very pleased</mark></p>
<h1>5104: <em><span style="color: green">+.373</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">A little bit of a tangle on and off, but easy once you get the hang.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm 2X with big belly and XXXL fits perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You tie it in the back and it hangs kind of loose showing enough back to be sexy without showing side rolls.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Love!</mark></p>

<h1>5107: <em><span style="color: green">+.425</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS YOGA TOP.</mark> <mark class = "pos">FIT IS GREAT WITH TIE BACK YOU CAN ADJUST TO HOW MUCH YOU WANT THE FLOW IN FRONT.</mark> <mark class = "pos">GREAT QUALITY SO FAR NO PROBLEMS A LITTLE DIFFERENT PUTTING ON MAKING SURE THE OPEN HANGS IN BACK BUT ONCE ON VERY NICE AND WORTH THE FEW MINS TO FIGURE OUT.</mark> <mark class = "pos">WOULD RECOMMEND TO BUY.

<h1>5111: <em><span style="color: green">+.292</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">It's a good quality.</mark> The length of the tank top could be a bit longer. And the sports bra could be a little tighter to hold you in.</p>
