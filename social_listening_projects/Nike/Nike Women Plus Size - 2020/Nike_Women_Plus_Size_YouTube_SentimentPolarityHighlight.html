<h1>1098: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">She said for the grey she got a size medium because they run a size bigger.. which must be true if shes in a medium as a l/xl girl. The others though you need to size up, they run small.</p>
<h1>1099: <em><span style="color: green">+.115</span></em></h1><p class="indented">They don't sell plus sizes at all only XS-L (or maybe XL) and all sizes are the same fabric. <mark class = "neg">I do notice some people saying in a review that a certain legging is squat proof but then another review by someone else will say the same one is not so I think it differs by color and the fabric is more see through the more it stretches too so I guess if you wear too small a size it seems thinner and not squat proof but really just need to size up?</mark> <mark class = "pos">Like I have the Energy Seamless in black & gray size large and they're fine, but watching some reviews girls saying it's completely see through but they're also squeezing into size small and extra small when they should probably be wearing a medium 🤷🏻‍♀️</mark></p>

<h1>1450: <em><span style="color: green">+.109</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Giselle Cardenas honestly I didn't want to be the one to say that. <mark class = "pos">I usually can wear a XS in active wear but my gymshark S is perfect.</mark> If it fits, it's fits. Just saying...</p>
<h1>1451: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Then they need to make XLs For bigger girls</p>
<h1>1452: <em><span style="color: red">-.281</span></em></h1><p class="indented">No it isnt lol. <mark class = "neg">The stuff is cute but the quality is not high in any way shape or form</mark></p>
<h1>1453: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">And even their athletes say a lot of the leggings arent squat proof</p>

<h1>1455: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Kristen Hutchins gymshark doesn't claim that all their leggings are squat proof ...</p>
<h1>1456: <em><span style="color: green">+.224</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Bentleys Mom yeah I agree</mark></p>
<h1>1457: <em><span style="color: red">-.265</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Giselle Cardenas no lol, you did. <mark class = "neg">Hence incorrect</mark></p>
<h1>1458: <em><span style="color: green">+.204</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Exactly what I said what size is she they only got up to a US size 12 I wear a L and I love them there so comfy and they make my bum look amazing there not a true plus size brand so if you are over a size 12 I wouldn't bother buying them x</mark></p>
<h1>1459: <em><span style="color: green">+.285</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Kristen Hutchins depends on what line you get, I get the flex and they're squat proof, so I think it just depends as each line is made from a different type of material.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I agree that they should expand sizing wise too, but they're an up and coming brand so hopefully in future they'll expand on sizing options.</mark></p>
<h1>1460: <em><span style="color: green">+.316</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Sarah Nicole why I don't think they advertise to be for plus size and probably don't want to be but I'm pretty sure somewhere down the line they will get pressured too</mark></p>
<h1>1461: <em><span style="color: green">+.052</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Exactly my thoughts. <mark class = "pos">Have them in flex (size m) and energy seamless (size L), could not be more happier.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Can't wait for blackout sale to buy me some more :)</mark></p>
<h1>1462: <em><span style="color: green">+.303</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Yes I've never had a problem w them being see through or feeling cheap or anything.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Everything I've bought is really high quality</mark></p>
<h1>1463: <em><span style="color: green">+.124</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I have the vital seamless in size medium, flex leggings in medium and energy seamless in large....</mark> and they are all squatproof for me. <mark class = "pos">They don't fit me too tight which helps with the material not over stretching.</mark> I'm normally between a small and med.</p>
<h1>1464: <em><span style="color: green">+.369</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Yes, I have 20 pairs of gymshark leggings, so good quality and all of them are squat proof 😍 just love them.</mark> But they should def do sizes that are XL and maybe XXL 😍💪🏼💪🏼</p>
<h1>1465: <em><span style="color: red">-.121</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Rebecka Peterson I have like 20 pair of leggings shut the fuck up you probably only have one 🤔</mark></p>
<h1>1466: <em><span style="color: green">+.266</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Becka Peterson I have none - not comfortable paying coin without trying on.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But I def thin they should do an XL to include as well.</mark></p>
<h1>1467: <em><span style="color: green">+.427</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I think "super high"is a bit of a stretch...</mark></p>
<h1>1468: <em><span style="color: red">-.038</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">Kristen Hutchins i have 3 pairs and they're all squat proof, the only ones people and athletes have had a problem with are the lilac ones they're started adding built in pant things to stop that from happening.</mark></p>
<h1>1469: <em><span style="color: green">+.197</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Nah that's not true at all. I've watched other hauls where the girl was small, bought an xs, small, and medium and not a single one was squat proof. <mark class = "pos">It depends on what kind you get, not necessarily the size.</mark> Someone who typically wears a size 4 shouldn't need a medium just so it's not see thru. <mark class = "pos">They need better quality attire.</mark></p>
<h1>1470: <em><span style="color: green">+.092</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Right!!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you get your correct size they are squat proof.</mark> She shoulda sized up. <mark class = "pos">She says she wears a med in Nike, shit I wear a large in Nike (comfortably) and she's bigger than me.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Sis gotta suck it up and get her real size, this isn't about being cute it's about being able to get your workout in.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Listen, I have nude and cut the panty liner out and they are still squat proof.</mark></p>
<h1>1471: <em><span style="color: green">+.063</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I wear gymshark too and I love it.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It fits me great and I don't have perfect body either.</mark> None of my pants are see through</p>
<h1>1472: <em><span style="color: red">-.348</span></em></h1><p class="indented">No they aren't squat proof! <mark class = "neg">And very low quality, always having holes after few uses etc.</mark> <mark class = "neg">Gymshark is trash, cheap</mark></p>

<h1>6597: <em><span style="color: green">+.140</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">To clarify!</mark> You have the first five days of every month to choose an "outfit" or you get charged $49.95. <mark class = "pos">This will go into credit towards your next purchase though, it is not a charge for being a member.</mark> Within the first five days of the month, you can choose to "skip the month", so you will NOT be charged after day 5, but you can go back at anytime and buy anything! <mark class = "neg">I've been a member for almost 2 years and I always skip the month and have never had an issue otherwise :) I haven't bought a lot from them but everything I have bought I absolutely adore!</mark></p>
<h1>6598: <em><span style="color: green">+.075</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">xstrobelightx9 thanks for explaining!</mark> <mark class = "neg">That seems a little more fair but I hate trying to keep up with stuff like that or allowing a company to charge my account.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I have very few things that I allow to direct draft and I prefer to keep it to the bare minimum, if any at all.</mark> <mark class = "pos">At least this seems like a more fair setup than most but I still just don't feel comfortable with the setup.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Wish these places would just charge what they charge without the gimmicks and commitments.</mark></p>

<h1>6602: <em><span style="color: red">-.106</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I have never bought anything in the first 5 days of the month, so I don't want to give you the wrong information but I believe that would work!</mark></p>

<h1>6604: <em><span style="color: green">+.216</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Fabletics is also really good about reminding you that you can skip every month!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I never set up a reminder I always just get the email that they send to remind me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Also you don't have to cancel over the phone, I'm pretty sure you can just cancel over the website.</mark></p>

<h1>6609: <em><span style="color: green">+.143</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Kenzie Gardner I know it's been a while since you asked but it seems no one answered your question. <mark class = "pos">Every month there is a list of certain outfits that you can buy together for cheaper and quite a lot of them are 49.95 but you also have the option to purchase more expensive outfits.</mark> <mark class = "pos">If you don't skip or choose your outfit in the first 5 days of the month, you will automatically be charged the 49.95 but it goes directly into your account and can be spent at any time in the future, but I'm pretty sure it can only be spent on one of your monthly outfits.</mark> <mark class = "neg">If you chose to buy an outfit of the month that is only 49.95, then you just pay shipping but if the outfit you select is more then you pay the difference and the shipping.</mark></p>

<h1>6827: <em><span style="color: red">-.006</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I was subscribed to fabletics vip some time but is ridiculously expensive and i spent a lottt in workout clothes because yeah is really cute and kind of unique but no that doesn't justify how expensive it is.</mark> <mark class = "neg">And yeah is like $49.95 a month but the one thing that dissapointed me is that all the cutest outfits that I wanted were like $60 or even more for the complete outfit (top or bra and leggings) what I am trying to tell is that for $50 a month your aren't going to find many options because the cutest are more expensive than that.</mark> <mark class = "pos">And if you are like me that doesn't  wear just sport bras and need also  a top so at the end one complete outfit of a vip can be easily like $80.</mark> So I decided to canceled because I just can't . And yeah you can skipped the month if you want. But you are going to end spending at the end tons of $$$ in workout clothes.</p>

Usually a 2x fits me but sometimes I literally can't get a 2x over my head. Just saying.</p>
<h1>6851: <em><span style="color: green">+.250</span></em></h1><p class="indented">I thought u could only get the 2 for 24 promo if you signed up for the VIP membership?

<h1>6852: <em><span style="color: red">-.174</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Yeah, you have to sign up for the VIP membership.

<h1>6853: <em><span style="color: green">+.288</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I LOVE their leggings.</mark> I literally just shop their semi annual sales and skip the month every month. <mark class = "pos">I just spent like $200 but I got like 6 pairs of leggings, 2 maxi dresses, a jacket, a sweatshirt and 2 tops.</mark></p>
<h1>6854: <em><span style="color: #D0D0D0">.000</span></em></h1><p class="indented">ClawsthatCatch when is their semi annual sale?</p>

<h1>6856: <em><span style="color: green">+.494</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I also hear really, really good things about their shoes, though I've never tried them!</mark> <mark class = "pos">They're just an overall reliable place for athletic wear/athleisure and thank GOD because plus size women deserve cute athletic wear too!</mark></p>

<h1>9543: <em><span style="color: red">-.232</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">I looked this up to figure out sizing for myself and didn't expect to hear so much negative self talk.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I know we're all on our own journeys, but talking about your body as if it's "bad"to be fat on a public platform is harmful.</mark> <mark class = "neg">There's nothing wrong with it.</mark> No one is judging you—just yourself. <mark class = "pos">You don't "need to get rid of”anything, that just diet culture.</mark> <mark class = "neg">You look beautiful in these outfits and I wish you'd be more accepting of yourself.</mark></p>

<h1>9545: <em><span style="color: green">+.061</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Meaghan Wray came across your comment.

<h1>9565: <em><span style="color: green">+.120</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">It was so distracting!</mark> <mark class = "pos">However, I have ADD, so anything shiny and bright gets my focus 🙂</mark></p>
<h1>9566: <em><span style="color: green">+.321</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I'm so happy your doing this especially Fabletics bc I've seen them everywhere and everyone is sponsored by them so of course they aren't going to tell you the truth if they are actually good or not.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I've been intrigued by them especially bc I'm plus size and they are very inclusive but I want to know how they fit, are they true to size, are they cut correctly for plus sizes, etc.</mark></p>
<h1>9567: <em><span style="color: green">+.294</span></em></h1><p class="indented">YESSSS!!! <mark class = "neg">And you're so right… It doesn't even matter that sometimes when people are sponsored you might trust what they have to say, it's just that there's always the question in the pit of your stomach of whether they're leaving something out or not.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I honestly don't think for this time of year I could've picked a better first choice for this video series, and I really hope that more people end up watching it and loving it as much as I do.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's definitely not doing as well as my other videos right now, but I really hope that changes!</mark></p>
<h1>9568: <em><span style="color: green">+.120</span></em></h1><p class="indented">YEAH! YEAH!! YEAH!!! <mark class = "pos">I have been WAITING (oh so patiently) for your review on this.</mark> You mentioned doing one back when you first wore that camo shirt after you got it. <mark class = "pos">Okay, first of all, this video was great for so many reasons.</mark> Super informative and you broke down all the info into things that I would want answered if I was considering buying. <mark class = "pos">Financial, the return policy, QUALITY, ship time.....</mark> just all of it. I can't think of one question I have about Fabletics that you didn't cover. <mark class = "pos">So, thank you for doing all that work for me!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Second, I could see how excited you are by this whole project and I think it's a phenomenal idea......</mark> <mark class = "pos">and the fact that it's being done by someone who is detail-oriented and doesn't ever "half-ass" a review on anything is just freakin' perfect.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Third, ya ain't got nothin' to be nervous about, Paige.</mark> Ya fuckin' nailed it!! <mark class = "pos">Love ya, girl.</mark> Gotta go get me some Fabletics now. Yeah, I'll be using your link when I finally pull the trigger. <mark class = "pos">Off the top of my head, maybe think about doing Rent the Runway?</mark> <mark class = "neg">They've been around for a minute, but they now have different levels, plus sizing with more than a handful of options, and they've been advertising like crazy everywhere lately.</mark> <mark class = "neg">I've been thinking about doing it just because we have a ski trip coming up and I don't want to buy a bunch of cold weather gear that I'll only wear that one time.</mark></p>
<h1>9569: <em><span style="color: green">+.328</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Oh my word Shannon, I can't tell you how insanely sweet this comment is to me!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Thank you so much for being so reassuring and so encouraging… You're definitely right, this project means a lot to me and I'm so glad that that came across that only and the happiness that I portrayed but also in the amount of detail and thought that went into it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Sometimes it can be really difficult to put up a video like this because my channel, while I have started to evolve it lately, was really found it on make up so the views for something like this are not good… They're not good at all.</mark> <mark class = "neg">That being said, I've never been the type of person that really got overly weighted down by that type of thing, but it does wear on a person after you put so many hours of work and money into something like this to have it not do so well… Comments like this make it so much more worth it though, and I just wanted you to know that ❤️</mark></p>
<h1>9570: <em><span style="color: green">+.129</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Seeking Alexandria the numbers may not be there right now, but the enthusiasm and drive definitely is.</mark> <mark class = "pos">The numbers will come or they won't, but making content you love feeds your soul, obviously.</mark> <mark class = "pos">So a couple videos a month that don't do as well initially are kind of heart breaking because you poured your soul into that shit, but if this is the kind of content that you're inspired to make then girl, keep on making it and feeding that creative soul.</mark> <mark class = "neg">It'll all shake out the way it's supposed to in the end.</mark> <mark class = "neg">And the shopping for the ski trip isn't the only thing I'm not looking forward to, the ACTUAL skiing isn't real high up on my damn list either.</mark> Which makes no sense for a girl raised in the Rockies in NW Montana, but there ya go....</p>
<h1>9571: <em><span style="color: green">+.137</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Something like Hungry Harvest or Imperfect Produce.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I just heard of this and I'm curious.</mark></p>
<h1>9572: <em><span style="color: green">+.231</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">So, funny story.</mark> The first ad in this episode, Fabletics 🤣😂

<h1>9573: <em><span style="color: green">+.299</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I LOVE 💕 this concept and the way you thought of all the questions we are consumers would have is perfect!</mark> <mark class = "pos">I look forward to more of these</mark></p>
<h1>9574: <em><span style="color: green">+.364</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Thank you Hannah!</mark> <mark class = "pos">The questions for me were definitely important… Because I almost never pull the trigger on random things online because I can't get answers to those questions LOL so I thought it would be a great place to start.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm so glad you enjoyed the video!</mark></p>
<h1>9575: <em><span style="color: green">+.252</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Seeking Alexandria girl I ALWAYS enjoy your videos.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You are the highlight to my mornings (: your personality and honesty just make you stand out and allow us to connect to you in a way we just can't with other youtubers</mark></p>
<h1>9576: <em><span style="color: green">+.193</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I've always been intrigued about fabletics because it's only online.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I like to be able to return in person.</mark> Returning in the mail scares me. <mark class = "pos">Thank you❤️❤️❤️❤️</mark></p>
<h1>9577: <em><span style="color: green">+.201</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Absolutely understand… That's the one downside to them- not having that physical location can be really limiting for some people.</mark></p>
<h1>9578: <em><span style="color: green">+.104</span></em></h1><p class="indented">Hi! There are physical locations for Fabletics! <mark class = "pos">I'm in New Jersey and they have a store in one of the malls near me.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Worth a look in your area to see if they have any</mark></p>
<h1>9579: <em><span style="color: green">+.283</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Becca Byrnes Im in New Jersey too!!</mark> I never knew that!! Just looked it up. <mark class = "pos">There's one in garden state plaza!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Yay thank you</mark></p>
<h1>9580: <em><span style="color: green">+.289</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">iHeartZebraPrintt you're welcome!</mark></p>
<h1>9581: <em><span style="color: green">+.590</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I've been curious about them for a long time; especially now that I'm a trainer and a lot of the "fitness" stores want $80-115 for a pair of capris!$  Your personality is amazing and you're a perfect start for the week!</mark></p>
<h1>9582: <em><span style="color: green">+.241</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Thank you so much!!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Isn't that crazy?!</mark> I seriously always avoided nice leggings because of that, but these.... <mark class = "pos">oh man, these are a whole new animal!</mark></p>

<h1>9584: <em><span style="color: green">+.313</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">I think this idea will create some fun & interesting content.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I think it's def a great idea.</mark> <mark class = "pos">It's nice to hear from someone you trust that a product is or isnt worth it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">You just never know when you see all the sponsored posts if they are being honest in their opinions.</mark> <mark class = "pos">Now we will have you to let us know the truth lol🤗</mark></p>
<h1>9585: <em><span style="color: green">+.251</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Oh heck yes you do!!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">And honestly, that's one of the reasons that I wanted to do this type of video… So many of you talk about how you trust me and how you honestly believe something I say about a product, whether it's good or bad.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I wanted a way to apply that to everyone's general life, to more than just a make up they purchase.</mark> <mark class = "pos">I'm just over the moon that those of you that are enjoying this video are liking it for all the same reasons I liked it and wanted to create it.❤️❤️❤️</mark></p>
<h1>9586: <em><span style="color: green">+.706</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Can I just say I love watching how happy you are these days!!!</mark> <mark class = "pos">Hope your doing great Paige!!!💜 Love all the new content!</mark></p>
<h1>9587: <em><span style="color: green">+.215</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Oh my word thank you!!!</mark> I'm honestly so glad that you guys can see the difference in me… I'm still working on myself and working on not letting my surroundings or situation bother me so much. <mark class = "pos">Making all of these changes to my channel has cost me a lot on YouTube, but I feel so good about it that it still makes me smile!</mark> ❤️</p>

<h1>9609: <em><span style="color: green">+.358</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">Next can you do Shefit bc I've been seeing their ads on YouTube literally on every video I watch for the past 2 weeks and it looks very intriguing as well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">They are just super expensive and I'm not spending that kind of money until I see someone I trust like you review it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">But honest if a bra is amazing then I absolutely would spend $60 on it bc I have FFF boobs and once you find a great bra then you know what I mean about the price doesn't matter.</mark></p>
